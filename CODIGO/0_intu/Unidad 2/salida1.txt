      12300: 2019/09/01:   PHEBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
      12301: 2019/09/01:   SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
      12302: 2019/09/01:   PHEBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
      12303: 2019/09/01:   SILVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
      12304: 2019/09/01:     If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
      12305: 2019/09/01:     By giving love, your sorrow and my grief
      12306: 2019/09/01:     Were both extermin'd.
      12307: 2019/09/01:   PHEBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
      12308: 2019/09/01:   SILVIUS. I would have you.  
      12309: 2019/09/01:   PHEBE. Why, that were covetousness.
      12310: 2019/09/01:     Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
      12311: 2019/09/01:     And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
      12312: 2019/09/01:     But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
      12313: 2019/09/01:     Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
      12314: 2019/09/01:     I will endure; and I'll employ thee too.
      12315: 2019/09/01:     But do not look for further recompense
      12316: 2019/09/01:     Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
      12317: 2019/09/01:   SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
      12318: 2019/09/01:     And I in such a poverty of grace,
      12319: 2019/09/01:     That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
      12320: 2019/09/01:     To glean the broken ears after the man
      12321: 2019/09/01:     That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then
      12322: 2019/09/01:     A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
      12323: 2019/09/01:   PHEBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
      12324: 2019/09/01:   SILVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
      12325: 2019/09/01:     And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
      12326: 2019/09/01:     That the old carlot once was master of.
      12327: 2019/09/01:   PHEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
      12328: 2019/09/01:     'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.  
      12329: 2019/09/01:     But what care I for words? Yet words do well
      12330: 2019/09/01:     When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
      12331: 2019/09/01:     It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;
      12332: 2019/09/01:     But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.
      12333: 2019/09/01:     He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him
      12334: 2019/09/01:     Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
      12335: 2019/09/01:     Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
      12336: 2019/09/01:     He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;
      12337: 2019/09/01:     His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
      12338: 2019/09/01:     There was a pretty redness in his lip,
      12339: 2019/09/01:     A little riper and more lusty red
      12340: 2019/09/01:     Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
      12341: 2019/09/01:     Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
      12342: 2019/09/01:     There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
      12343: 2019/09/01:     In parcels as I did, would have gone near
      12344: 2019/09/01:     To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
      12345: 2019/09/01:     I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
      12346: 2019/09/01:     I have more cause to hate him than to love him;
      12347: 2019/09/01:     For what had he to do to chide at me?
      12348: 2019/09/01:     He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,  
      12349: 2019/09/01:     And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
      12350: 2019/09/01:     I marvel why I answer'd not again;
      12351: 2019/09/01:     But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.
      12352: 2019/09/01:     I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
      12353: 2019/09/01:     And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
      12354: 2019/09/01:   SILVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
      12355: 2019/09/01:   PHEBE. I'll write it straight;
      12356: 2019/09/01:     The matter's in my head and in my heart;
      12357: 2019/09/01:     I will be bitter with him and passing short.
      12358: 2019/09/01:     Go with me, Silvius.                                  Exeunt
      12359: 2019/09/01:

      12374: 2019/09/01: ACT IV. SCENE I.
      12375: 2019/09/01: The forest
      12376: 2019/09/01: 
      12377: 2019/09/01: Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES
      12378: 2019/09/01: 
      12379: 2019/09/01:   JAQUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
      12380: 2019/09/01:     thee.
      12381: 2019/09/01:   ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
      12382: 2019/09/01:   JAQUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
      12383: 2019/09/01:   ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
      12384: 2019/09/01:     fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than
      12385: 2019/09/01:     drunkards.
      12386: 2019/09/01:   JAQUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
      12387: 2019/09/01:   ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
      12388: 2019/09/01:   JAQUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
      12389: 2019/09/01:     emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the
      12390: 2019/09/01:     courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is
      12391: 2019/09/01:     ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's,
      12392: 2019/09/01:     which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a
      12393: 2019/09/01:     melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
      12394: 2019/09/01:     from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my
      12395: 2019/09/01:     travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous  
      12396: 2019/09/01:     sadness.
      12397: 2019/09/01:   ROSALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
      12398: 2019/09/01:     sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then
      12399: 2019/09/01:     to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
      12400: 2019/09/02:     poor hands.
      12401: 2019/09/02:   JAQUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
      12402: 2019/09/02: 
      12403: 2019/09/02:                         Enter ORLANDO
      12404: 2019/09/02: 
      12405: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
      12406: 2019/09/02:     fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to
      12407: 2019/09/02:     travel for it too.
      12408: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
      12409: 2019/09/02:   JAQUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
      12410: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
      12411: 2019/09/02:     strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be
      12412: 2019/09/02:     out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making
      12413: 2019/09/02:     you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have
      12414: 2019/09/02:     swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where
      12415: 2019/09/02:     have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such  
      12416: 2019/09/02:     another trick, never come in my sight more.
      12417: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
      12418: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
      12419: 2019/09/02:     minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the
      12420: 2019/09/02:     thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said
      12421: 2019/09/02:     of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll
      12422: 2019/09/02:     warrant him heart-whole.
      12423: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
      12424: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
      12425: 2019/09/02:     as lief be woo'd of a snail.
      12426: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. Of a snail!
      12427: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
      12428: 2019/09/02:     his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make
      12429: 2019/09/02:     a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.
      12430: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. What's that?
      12431: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
      12432: 2019/09/02:     your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents
      12433: 2019/09/02:     the slander of his wife.
      12434: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
      12435: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.  
      12436: 2019/09/02:   CELIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
      12437: 2019/09/02:     better leer than you.
      12438: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
      12439: 2019/09/02:     and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I
      12440: 2019/09/02:     were your very very Rosalind?
      12441: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
      12442: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
      12443: 2019/09/02:     gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
      12444: 2019/09/02:     Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
      12445: 2019/09/02:     lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to
      12446: 2019/09/02:     kiss.
      12447: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
      12448: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
      12449: 2019/09/02:     matter.
      12450: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
      12451: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
      12452: 2019/09/02:     should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
      12453: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. What, of my suit?
      12454: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
      12455: 2019/09/02:     Am not I your Rosalind?  
      12456: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
      12457: 2019/09/02:     of her.
      12458: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
      12459: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
      12460: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
      12461: 2019/09/02:     thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man
      12462: 2019/09/02:     died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had
      12463: 2019/09/02:     his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
      12464: 2019/09/02:     could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.
      12465: 2019/09/02:     Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had
      12466: 2019/09/02:     turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,
      12467: 2019/09/02:     good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,
      12468: 2019/09/02:     being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish
      12469: 2019/09/02:     chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these
      12470: 2019/09/02:     are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
      12471: 2019/09/02:     eaten them, but not for love.
      12472: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for, I
      12473: 2019/09/02:     protest, her frown might kill me.
      12474: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
      12475: 2019/09/02:     will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me  
      12476: 2019/09/02:     what you will, I will grant it.
      12477: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
      12478: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
      12479: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?
      12480: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
      12481: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. What sayest thou?
      12482: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Are you not good?
      12483: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. I hope so.
      12484: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come,
      12485: 2019/09/02:     sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,
      12486: 2019/09/02:     Orlando. What do you say, sister?
      12487: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
      12488: 2019/09/02:   CELIA. I cannot say the words.
      12489: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
      12490: 2019/09/02:   CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
      12491: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. I will.
      12492: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Ay, but when?
      12493: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
      12494: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
      12495: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.  
      12496: 2019/09/02:   ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
      12497: 2019/09/02:     Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;
      12498: 2019/09/02:     and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.
      12499: 2019/09/02:   ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
      12500: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
      12501: 2019/09/03:     possess'd her.
      12502: 2019/09/03:   ORLANDO. For ever and a day.
      12503: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
      12504: 2019/09/03:     April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when
      12505: 2019/09/03:     they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will
      12506: 2019/09/03:     be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
      12507: 2019/09/03:     more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than
      12508: 2019/09/03:     an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for
      12509: 2019/09/03:     nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you
      12510: 2019/09/03:     are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when
      12511: 2019/09/03:     thou are inclin'd to sleep.
      12512: 2019/09/03:   ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
      12513: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
      12514: 2019/09/03:   ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.
      12515: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,  
      12516: 2019/09/03:     the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out
      12517: 2019/09/03:     at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop
      12518: 2019/09/03:     that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
      12519: 2019/09/03:   ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
      12520: 2019/09/03:     whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your
      12521: 2019/09/03:     wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
      12522: 2019/09/03:   ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
      12523: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
      12524: 2019/09/03:     take her without her answer, unless you take her without her
      12525: 2019/09/03:     tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's
      12526: 2019/09/03:     occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will
      12527: 2019/09/03:     breed it like a fool!
      12528: 2019/09/03:   ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
      12529: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
      12530: 2019/09/03:   ORLANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
      12531: 2019/09/03:     with thee again.
      12532: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
      12533: 2019/09/03:     prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That
      12534: 2019/09/03:     flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and  
      12535: 2019/09/03:     so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
      12536: 2019/09/03:   ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
      12537: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
      12538: 2019/09/03:     by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot
      12539: 2019/09/03:     of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will
      12540: 2019/09/03:     think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow
      12541: 2019/09/03:     lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may
      12542: 2019/09/03:     be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore
      12543: 2019/09/03:     beware my censure, and keep your promise.
      12544: 2019/09/03:   ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
      12545: 2019/09/03:     Rosalind; so, adieu.
      12546: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
      12547: 2019/09/03:     offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO
      12548: 2019/09/03:   CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must
      12549: 2019/09/03:     have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the
      12550: 2019/09/03:     world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
      12551: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst
      12552: 2019/09/03:     know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded;
      12553: 2019/09/03:     my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
      12554: 2019/09/03:   CELIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection  
      12555: 2019/09/03:     in, it runs out.
      12556: 2019/09/03:   ROSALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
      12557: 2019/09/03:     thought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind
      12558: 2019/09/03:     rascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are
      12559: 2019/09/03:     out- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,
      12560: 2019/09/03:     Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a
      12561: 2019/09/03:     shadow, and sigh till he come.
      12562: 2019/09/03:   CELIA. And I'll sleep.                                  Exeunt
      12563: 2019/09/03: 
      12564: 2019/09/03: 
      12565: 2019/09/03: 
      12566: 2019/09/03: 
      12567: 2019/09/03: SCENE II.
      12568: 2019/09/03: The forest
      12569: 2019/09/03: 
      12570: 2019/09/03:         Enter JAQUES and LORDS, in the habit of foresters
      12571: 2019/09/03: 
      12572: 2019/09/03:   JAQUES. Which is he that killed the deer?
      12573: 2019/09/03:   LORD. Sir, it was I.
      12574: 2019/09/03:   JAQUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and
      12575: 2019/09/03:     it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a
      12576: 2019/09/03:     branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
      12577: 2019/09/03:   LORD. Yes, sir.
      12578: 2019/09/03:   JAQUES. Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise
      12579: 2019/09/03:     enough.
      12580: 2019/09/03: 
      12581: 2019/09/03:                     SONG.
      12582: 2019/09/03: 
      12583: 2019/09/03:       What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
      12584: 2019/09/03:       His leather skin and horns to wear.
      12585: 2019/09/03:                               [The rest shall hear this burden:]
      12586: 2019/09/03:            Then sing him home.
      12587: 2019/09/03: 
      12588: 2019/09/03:       Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;  
      12589: 2019/09/03:       It was a crest ere thou wast born.
      12590: 2019/09/03:            Thy father's father wore it;
      12591: 2019/09/03:            And thy father bore it.
      12592: 2019/09/03:       The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,
      12593: 2019/09/03:       Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.                   Exeunt
      12594: 2019/09/03: 
      12595: 2019/09/03: 
      12596: 2019/09/03: 
      12597: 2019/09/03: 
      12598: 2019/09/03: SCENE III.
      12599: 2019/09/03: The forest
      12600: 2019/09/04: 
      12601: 2019/09/04: Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
      12602: 2019/09/04: 
      12603: 2019/09/04:   ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
      12604: 2019/09/04:     And here much Orlando!
      12605: 2019/09/04:   CELIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
      12606: 2019/09/04:     ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep. Look, who
      12607: 2019/09/04:     comes here.
      12608: 2019/09/04: 
      12609: 2019/09/04:                       Enter SILVIUS
      12610: 2019/09/04: 
      12611: 2019/09/04:   SILVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
      12612: 2019/09/04:     My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.
      12613: 2019/09/04:     I know not the contents; but, as I guess
      12614: 2019/09/04:     By the stern brow and waspish action
      12615: 2019/09/04:     Which she did use as she was writing of it,
      12616: 2019/09/04:     It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me,
      12617: 2019/09/04:     I am but as a guiltless messenger.
      12618: 2019/09/04:   ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
      12619: 2019/09/04:     And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
      12620: 2019/09/04:     She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;  
      12621: 2019/09/04:     She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
      12622: 2019/09/04:     Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!
      12623: 2019/09/04:     Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
      12624: 2019/09/04:     Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
      12625: 2019/09/04:     This is a letter of your own device.
      12626: 2019/09/04:   SILVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
      12627: 2019/09/04:     Phebe did write it.
      12628: 2019/09/04:   ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
      12629: 2019/09/04:     And turn'd into the extremity of love.
      12630: 2019/09/04:     I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,
      12631: 2019/09/04:     A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
      12632: 2019/09/04:     That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;
      12633: 2019/09/04:     She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.
      12634: 2019/09/04:     I say she never did invent this letter:
      12635: 2019/09/04:     This is a man's invention, and his hand.
      12636: 2019/09/04:   SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
      12637: 2019/09/04:   ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
      12638: 2019/09/04:     A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
      12639: 2019/09/04:     Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
      12640: 2019/09/04:     Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,  
      12641: 2019/09/04:     Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
      12642: 2019/09/04:     Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
      12643: 2019/09/04:   SILVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
      12644: 2019/09/04:     Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
      12645: 2019/09/04:   ROSALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
      12646: 2019/09/04:                                                          [Reads]
      12647: 2019/09/04: 
      12648: 2019/09/04:             'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
      12649: 2019/09/04:             That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'
      12650: 2019/09/04: 
      12651: 2019/09/04:     Can a woman rail thus?
      12652: 2019/09/04:   SILVIUS. Call you this railing?
      12653: 2019/09/04:   ROSALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
      12654: 2019/09/04:              Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?'
      12655: 2019/09/04: 
      12656: 2019/09/04:     Did you ever hear such railing?
      12657: 2019/09/04: 
      12658: 2019/09/04:             'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
      12659: 2019/09/04:             That could do no vengeance to me.'
      12660: 2019/09/04:   
      12661: 2019/09/04:     Meaning me a beast.
      12662: 2019/09/04: 
      12663: 2019/09/04:             'If the scorn of your bright eyne
      12664: 2019/09/04:             Have power to raise such love in mine,
      12665: 2019/09/04:             Alack, in me what strange effect
      12666: 2019/09/04:             Would they work in mild aspect!
      12667: 2019/09/04:             Whiles you chid me, I did love;
      12668: 2019/09/04:             How then might your prayers move!
      12669: 2019/09/04:             He that brings this love to the
      12670: 2019/09/04:             Little knows this love in me;
      12671: 2019/09/04:             And by him seal up thy mind,
      12672: 2019/09/04:             Whether that thy youth and kind
      12673: 2019/09/04:             Will the faithful offer take
      12674: 2019/09/04:             Of me and all that I can make;
      12675: 2019/09/04:             Or else by him my love deny,
      12676: 2019/09/04:             And then I'll study how to die.'
      12677: 2019/09/04:   SILVIUS. Call you this chiding?
      12678: 2019/09/04:   CELIA. Alas, poor shepherd!
      12679: 2019/09/04:   ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
      12680: 2019/09/04:     such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false  
      12681: 2019/09/04:     strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
      12682: 2019/09/04:     for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
      12683: 2019/09/04:     that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
      12684: 2019/09/04:     I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
      12685: 2019/09/04:     true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.
      12686: 2019/09/04:                                                     Exit SILVIUS
      12687: 2019/09/04: 
      12688: 2019/09/04:                          Enter OLIVER
      12689: 2019/09/04: 
      12690: 2019/09/04:   OLIVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
      12691: 2019/09/04:     Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
      12692: 2019/09/04:     A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
      12693: 2019/09/04:   CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
      12694: 2019/09/04:     The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
      12695: 2019/09/04:     Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
      12696: 2019/09/04:     But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
      12697: 2019/09/04:     There's none within.
      12698: 2019/09/04:   OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
      12699: 2019/09/04:     Then should I know you by description-
      12700: 2019/09/05:     Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,  
      12701: 2019/09/05:     Of female favour, and bestows himself
      12702: 2019/09/05:     Like a ripe sister; the woman low,
      12703: 2019/09/05:     And browner than her brother.' Are not you
      12704: 2019/09/05:     The owner of the house I did inquire for?
      12705: 2019/09/05:   CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
      12706: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
      12707: 2019/09/05:     And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
      12708: 2019/09/05:     He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
      12709: 2019/09/05:   ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
      12710: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
      12711: 2019/09/05:     What man I am, and how, and why, and where,
      12712: 2019/09/05:     This handkercher was stain'd.
      12713: 2019/09/05:   CELIA. I pray you, tell it.
      12714: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
      12715: 2019/09/05:     He left a promise to return again
      12716: 2019/09/05:     Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,
      12717: 2019/09/05:     Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
      12718: 2019/09/05:     Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,
      12719: 2019/09/05:     And mark what object did present itself.
      12720: 2019/09/05:     Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,  
      12721: 2019/09/05:     And high top bald with dry antiquity,
      12722: 2019/09/05:     A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
      12723: 2019/09/05:     Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
      12724: 2019/09/05:     A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
      12725: 2019/09/05:     Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
      12726: 2019/09/05:     The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
      12727: 2019/09/05:     Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
      12728: 2019/09/05:     And with indented glides did slip away
      12729: 2019/09/05:     Into a bush; under which bush's shade
      12730: 2019/09/05:     A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
      12731: 2019/09/05:     Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
      12732: 2019/09/05:     When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
      12733: 2019/09/05:     The royal disposition of that beast
      12734: 2019/09/05:     To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
      12735: 2019/09/05:     This seen, Orlando did approach the man,
      12736: 2019/09/05:     And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
      12737: 2019/09/05:   CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
      12738: 2019/09/05:     And he did render him the most unnatural
      12739: 2019/09/05:     That liv'd amongst men.
      12740: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. And well he might so do,  
      12741: 2019/09/05:     For well I know he was unnatural.
      12742: 2019/09/05:   ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
      12743: 2019/09/05:     Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
      12744: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
      12745: 2019/09/05:     But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
      12746: 2019/09/05:     And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
      12747: 2019/09/05:     Made him give battle to the lioness,
      12748: 2019/09/05:     Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
      12749: 2019/09/05:     From miserable slumber I awak'd.
      12750: 2019/09/05:   CELIA. Are you his brother?
      12751: 2019/09/05:   ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
      12752: 2019/09/05:   CELIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
      12753: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
      12754: 2019/09/05:     To tell you what I was, since my conversion
      12755: 2019/09/05:     So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
      12756: 2019/09/05:   ROSALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
      12757: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. By and by.
      12758: 2019/09/05:     When from the first to last, betwixt us two,
      12759: 2019/09/05:     Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,
      12760: 2019/09/05:     As how I came into that desert place-  
      12761: 2019/09/05:     In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,
      12762: 2019/09/05:     Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
      12763: 2019/09/05:     Committing me unto my brother's love;
      12764: 2019/09/05:     Who led me instantly unto his cave,
      12765: 2019/09/05:     There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
      12766: 2019/09/05:     The lioness had torn some flesh away,
      12767: 2019/09/05:     Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
      12768: 2019/09/05:     And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
      12769: 2019/09/05:     Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,
      12770: 2019/09/05:     And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
      12771: 2019/09/05:     He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
      12772: 2019/09/05:     To tell this story, that you might excuse
      12773: 2019/09/05:     His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
      12774: 2019/09/05:     Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
      12775: 2019/09/05:     That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
      12776: 2019/09/05:                                                [ROSALIND swoons]
      12777: 2019/09/05:   CELIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
      12778: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
      12779: 2019/09/05:   CELIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
      12780: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. Look, he recovers.  
      12781: 2019/09/05:   ROSALIND. I would I were at home.
      12782: 2019/09/05:   CELIA. We'll lead you thither.
      12783: 2019/09/05:     I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
      12784: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
      12785: 2019/09/05:     You lack a man's heart.
      12786: 2019/09/05:   ROSALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
      12787: 2019/09/05:     this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how
      12788: 2019/09/05:     well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
      12789: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
      12790: 2019/09/05:     your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
      12791: 2019/09/05:   ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
      12792: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
      12793: 2019/09/05:   ROSALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
      12794: 2019/09/05:     right.
      12795: 2019/09/05:   CELIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
      12796: 2019/09/05:     Good sir, go with us.
      12797: 2019/09/05:   OLIVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back
      12798: 2019/09/05:     How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
      12799: 2019/09/05:   ROSALIND. I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my
      12800: 2019/09/06:     counterfeiting to him. Will you go?                   Exeunt

      12817: 2019/09/06: The forest
      12818: 2019/09/06: 
      12819: 2019/09/06: Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
      12820: 2019/09/06: 
      12821: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
      12822: 2019/09/06:   AUDREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
      12823: 2019/09/06:     gentleman's saying.
      12824: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
      12825: 2019/09/06:     But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to
      12826: 2019/09/06:     you.
      12827: 2019/09/06:   AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the
      12828: 2019/09/06:     world; here comes the man you mean.
      12829: 2019/09/06: 
      12830: 2019/09/06:                          Enter WILLIAM
      12831: 2019/09/06: 
      12832: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth,
      12833: 2019/09/06:     we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be
      12834: 2019/09/06:     flouting; we cannot hold.
      12835: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. Good ev'n, Audrey.
      12836: 2019/09/06:   AUDREY. God ye good ev'n, William.
      12837: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. And good ev'n to you, sir.  
      12838: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
      12839: 2019/09/06:     head; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, friend?
      12840: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. Five and twenty, sir.
      12841: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?
      12842: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. William, sir.
      12843: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
      12844: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.
      12845: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.
      12846: 2019/09/06:     Art rich?
      12847: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.
      12848: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
      12849: 2019/09/06:     yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
      12850: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
      12851: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying: 'The
      12852: 2019/09/06:     fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be
      12853: 2019/09/06:     a fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a
      12854: 2019/09/06:     grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning
      12855: 2019/09/06:     thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do
      12856: 2019/09/06:     love this maid?
      12857: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. I do, sir.  
      12858: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
      12859: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. No, sir.
      12860: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a
      12861: 2019/09/06:     figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a
      12862: 2019/09/06:     glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your
      12863: 2019/09/06:     writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I
      12864: 2019/09/06:     am he.
      12865: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. Which he, sir?
      12866: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
      12867: 2019/09/06:     clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which
      12868: 2019/09/06:     in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is
      12869: 2019/09/06:     woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,
      12870: 2019/09/06:     clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;
      12871: 2019/09/06:     or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into
      12872: 2019/09/06:     death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,
      12873: 2019/09/06:     or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction;
      12874: 2019/09/06:     will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and
      12875: 2019/09/06:     fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
      12876: 2019/09/06:   AUDREY. Do, good William.
      12877: 2019/09/06:   WILLIAM. God rest you merry, sir.                         Exit  
      12878: 2019/09/06: 
      12879: 2019/09/06:                           Enter CORIN
      12880: 2019/09/06: 
      12881: 2019/09/06:   CORIN. Our master and mistress seeks you; come away, away.
      12882: 2019/09/06:   TOUCHSTONE. Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.
      12883: 2019/09/06:                                                           Exeunt
      12884: 2019/09/06: 
      12885: 2019/09/06: 
      12886: 2019/09/06: 
      12887: 2019/09/06: 
      12888: 2019/09/06: SCENE II.
      12889: 2019/09/06: The forest
      12890: 2019/09/06: 
      12891: 2019/09/06: Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER
      12892: 2019/09/06: 
      12893: 2019/09/06:   ORLANDO. Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should
      12894: 2019/09/06:     like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo?
      12895: 2019/09/06:     and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy
      12896: 2019/09/06:     her?
      12897: 2019/09/06:   OLIVER. Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty
      12898: 2019/09/06:     of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden
      12899: 2019/09/06:     consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she
      12900: 2019/09/07:     loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It
      12901: 2019/09/07:     shall be to your good; for my father's house and all the revenue
      12902: 2019/09/07:     that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here live
      12903: 2019/09/07:     and die a shepherd.
      12904: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.
      12905: 2019/09/07:     Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers. Go
      12906: 2019/09/07:     you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.
      12907: 2019/09/07: 
      12908: 2019/09/07:                         Enter ROSALIND
      12909: 2019/09/07:   
      12910: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. God save you, brother.
      12911: 2019/09/07:   OLIVER. And you, fair sister.                             Exit
      12912: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
      12913: 2019/09/07:     thy heart in a scarf!
      12914: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. It is my arm.
      12915: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
      12916: 2019/09/07:     lion.
      12917: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
      12918: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
      12919: 2019/09/07:     when he show'd me your handkercher?
      12920: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.
      12921: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never
      12922: 2019/09/07:     any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's
      12923: 2019/09/07:     thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother
      12924: 2019/09/07:     and my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but
      12925: 2019/09/07:     they lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but
      12926: 2019/09/07:     they ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but
      12927: 2019/09/07:     they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair
      12928: 2019/09/07:     of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else
      12929: 2019/09/07:     be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of  
      12930: 2019/09/07:     love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.
      12931: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke
      12932: 2019/09/07:     to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into
      12933: 2019/09/07:     happiness through another man's eyes! By so much the more shall I
      12934: 2019/09/07:     to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I
      12935: 2019/09/07:     shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
      12936: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
      12937: 2019/09/07:     Rosalind?
      12938: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.
      12939: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking. Know
      12940: 2019/09/07:     of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are
      12941: 2019/09/07:     a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should
      12942: 2019/09/07:     bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you
      12943: 2019/09/07:     are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some
      12944: 2019/09/07:     little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and
      12945: 2019/09/07:     not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do
      12946: 2019/09/07:     strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd
      12947: 2019/09/07:     with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.
      12948: 2019/09/07:     If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries
      12949: 2019/09/07:     it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her. I  
      12950: 2019/09/07:     know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not
      12951: 2019/09/07:     impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set
      12952: 2019/09/07:     her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any
      12953: 2019/09/07:     danger.
      12954: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
      12955: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I
      12956: 2019/09/07:     am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your
      12957: 2019/09/07:     friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to
      12958: 2019/09/07:     Rosalind, if you will.
      12959: 2019/09/07: 
      12960: 2019/09/07:                      Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
      12961: 2019/09/07: 
      12962: 2019/09/07:     Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.
      12963: 2019/09/07:   PHEBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
      12964: 2019/09/07:     To show the letter that I writ to you.
      12965: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study
      12966: 2019/09/07:     To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
      12967: 2019/09/07:     You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;
      12968: 2019/09/07:     Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
      12969: 2019/09/07:   PHEBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.  
      12970: 2019/09/07:   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
      12971: 2019/09/07:     And so am I for Phebe.
      12972: 2019/09/07:   PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
      12973: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
      12974: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
      12975: 2019/09/07:   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of faith and service;
      12976: 2019/09/07:     And so am I for Phebe.
      12977: 2019/09/07:   PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
      12978: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
      12979: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
      12980: 2019/09/07:   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,
      12981: 2019/09/07:     All made of passion, and all made of wishes;
      12982: 2019/09/07:     All adoration, duty, and observance,
      12983: 2019/09/07:     All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,
      12984: 2019/09/07:     All purity, all trial, all obedience;
      12985: 2019/09/07:     And so am I for Phebe.
      12986: 2019/09/07:   PHEBE. And so am I for Ganymede.
      12987: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.
      12988: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. And so am I for no woman.
      12989: 2019/09/07:   PHEBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?  
      12990: 2019/09/07:   SILVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
      12991: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
      12992: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
      12993: 2019/09/07:   ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
      12994: 2019/09/07:   ROSALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish
      12995: 2019/09/07:     wolves against the moon. [To SILVIUS] I will help you if I can.
      12996: 2019/09/07:     [To PHEBE] I would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me all
      12997: 2019/09/07:     together. [ To PHEBE ] I will marry you if ever I marry woman,
      12998: 2019/09/07:     and I'll be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] I will satisfy you if
      12999: 2019/09/07:     ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. [To
      13000: 2019/09/08:     Silvius] I will content you if what pleases you contents you, and
      13001: 2019/09/08:     you shall be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] As you love
      13002: 2019/09/08:     Rosalind, meet. [To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I
      13003: 2019/09/08:     love no woman, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you
      13004: 2019/09/08:     commands.
      13005: 2019/09/08:   SILVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.
      13006: 2019/09/08:   PHEBE. Nor I.
      13007: 2019/09/08:   ORLANDO. Nor I.                                         Exeunt
      13008: 2019/09/08:

      13013: 2019/09/08: The forest
      13014: 2019/09/08: 
      13015: 2019/09/08: Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
      13016: 2019/09/08: 
      13017: 2019/09/08:   TOUCHSTONE. To-morrow is the joyful day, Audre'y; to-morrow will we
      13018: 2019/09/08:     be married.
      13019: 2019/09/08:   AUDREY. I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no
      13020: 2019/09/08:     dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come
      13021: 2019/09/08:     two of the banish'd Duke's pages.
      13022: 2019/09/08: 
      13023: 2019/09/08:                             Enter two PAGES
      13024: 2019/09/08: 
      13025: 2019/09/08:   FIRST PAGE. Well met, honest gentleman.
      13026: 2019/09/08:   TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.
      13027: 2019/09/08:   SECOND PAGE. We are for you; sit i' th' middle.
      13028: 2019/09/08:   FIRST PAGE. Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or
      13029: 2019/09/08:     spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues
      13030: 2019/09/08:     to a bad voice?
      13031: 2019/09/08:   SECOND PAGE. I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies
      13032: 2019/09/08:     on a horse.
      13033: 2019/09/08:   
      13034: 2019/09/08:                       SONG.
      13035: 2019/09/08:         It was a lover and his lass,
      13036: 2019/09/08:           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
      13037: 2019/09/08:         That o'er the green corn-field did pass
      13038: 2019/09/08:           In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
      13039: 2019/09/08:         When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
      13040: 2019/09/08:         Sweet lovers love the spring.
      13041: 2019/09/08: 
      13042: 2019/09/08:         Between the acres of the rye,
      13043: 2019/09/08:           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
      13044: 2019/09/08:         These pretty country folks would lie,
      13045: 2019/09/08:           In the spring time, &c.
      13046: 2019/09/08: 
      13047: 2019/09/08:         This carol they began that hour,
      13048: 2019/09/08:           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
      13049: 2019/09/08:         How that a life was but a flower,
      13050: 2019/09/08:           In the spring time, &c.
      13051: 2019/09/08: 
      13052: 2019/09/08:         And therefore take the present time,
      13053: 2019/09/08:           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,  
      13054: 2019/09/08:         For love is crowned with the prime,
      13055: 2019/09/08:           In the spring time, &c.
      13056: 2019/09/08: 
      13057: 2019/09/08:   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
      13058: 2019/09/08:     matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.
      13059: 2019/09/08:   FIRST PAGE. YOU are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our
      13060: 2019/09/08:     time.
      13061: 2019/09/08:   TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such
      13062: 2019/09/08:     a foolish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come,
      13063: 2019/09/08:     Audrey.                                               Exeunt

      13069: 2019/09/08: The forest
      13070: 2019/09/08: 
      13071: 2019/09/08: Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA
      13072: 2019/09/08: 
      13073: 2019/09/08:   DUKE SENIOR. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
      13074: 2019/09/08:     Can do all this that he hath promised?
      13075: 2019/09/08:   ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:
      13076: 2019/09/08:     As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
      13077: 2019/09/08: 
      13078: 2019/09/08:                Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE
      13079: 2019/09/08: 
      13080: 2019/09/08:   ROSALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:
      13081: 2019/09/08:     You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
      13082: 2019/09/08:     You will bestow her on Orlando here?
      13083: 2019/09/08:   DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
      13084: 2019/09/08:   ROSALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?
      13085: 2019/09/08:   ORLANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
      13086: 2019/09/08:   ROSALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
      13087: 2019/09/08:   PHEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.
      13088: 2019/09/08:   ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,  
      13089: 2019/09/08:     You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
      13090: 2019/09/08:   PHEBE. So is the bargain.
      13091: 2019/09/08:   ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
      13092: 2019/09/08:   SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.
      13093: 2019/09/08:   ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even.
      13094: 2019/09/08:     Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;
      13095: 2019/09/08:     You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;
      13096: 2019/09/08:     Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
      13097: 2019/09/08:     Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;
      13098: 2019/09/08:     Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her
      13099: 2019/09/08:     If she refuse me; and from hence I go,
      13100: 2019/09/09:     To make these doubts all even.
      13101: 2019/09/09:                                        Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
      13102: 2019/09/09:   DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy
      13103: 2019/09/09:     Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
      13104: 2019/09/09:   ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
      13105: 2019/09/09:     Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
      13106: 2019/09/09:     But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
      13107: 2019/09/09:     And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
      13108: 2019/09/09:     Of many desperate studies by his uncle,  
      13109: 2019/09/09:     Whom he reports to be a great magician,
      13110: 2019/09/09:     Obscured in the circle of this forest.
      13111: 2019/09/09: 
      13112: 2019/09/09:                     Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
      13113: 2019/09/09: 
      13114: 2019/09/09:   JAQUES. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are
      13115: 2019/09/09:     coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which
      13116: 2019/09/09:     in all tongues are call'd fools.
      13117: 2019/09/09:   TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!
      13118: 2019/09/09:   JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded
      13119: 2019/09/09:     gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a
      13120: 2019/09/09:      courtier, he swears.
      13121: 2019/09/09:   TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
      13122: 2019/09/09:     I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been
      13123: 2019/09/09:     politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone
      13124: 2019/09/09:     three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought
      13125: 2019/09/09:     one.
      13126: 2019/09/09:   JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?
      13127: 2019/09/09:   TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
      13128: 2019/09/09:     seventh cause.  
      13129: 2019/09/09:   JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
      13130: 2019/09/09:   DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.
      13131: 2019/09/09:   TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in
      13132: 2019/09/09:     here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear
      13133: 2019/09/09:     and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A
      13134: 2019/09/09:     poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a
      13135: 2019/09/09:     poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich
      13136: 2019/09/09:     honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl
      13137: 2019/09/09:     in your foul oyster.
      13138: 2019/09/09:   DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
      13139: 2019/09/09:   TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
      13140: 2019/09/09:     diseases.
      13141: 2019/09/09:   JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on
      13142: 2019/09/09:     the seventh cause?
      13143: 2019/09/09:   TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more
      13144: 2019/09/09:     seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain
      13145: 2019/09/09:     courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not
      13146: 2019/09/09:     cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort
      13147: 2019/09/09:     Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would
      13148: 2019/09/09:     send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip  
      13149: 2019/09/09:     Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.
      13150: 2019/09/09:     This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,
      13151: 2019/09/09:     he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof
      13152: 2019/09/09:     Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This
      13153: 2019/09/09:     is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie
      13154: 2019/09/09:     Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
      13155: 2019/09/09:   JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
      13156: 2019/09/09:   TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor
      13157: 2019/09/09:     he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords
      13158: 2019/09/09:     and parted.
      13159: 2019/09/09:   JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
      13160: 2019/09/09:   TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have
      13161: 2019/09/09:     books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,
      13162: 2019/09/09:     the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the
      13163: 2019/09/09:     Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
      13164: 2019/09/09:     Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;
      13165: 2019/09/09:     the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie
      13166: 2019/09/09:     Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven
      13167: 2019/09/09:     justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were
      13168: 2019/09/09:     met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you  
      13169: 2019/09/09:     said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore
      13170: 2019/09/09:     brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.
      13171: 2019/09/09:   JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
      13172: 2019/09/09:     He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.
      13173: 2019/09/09:   DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the
      13174: 2019/09/09:     presentation of that he shoots his wit:
      13175: 2019/09/09: 
      13176: 2019/09/09:           Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Still MUSIC
      13177: 2019/09/09: 
      13178: 2019/09/09:     HYMEN.    Then is there mirth in heaven,
      13179: 2019/09/09:               When earthly things made even
      13180: 2019/09/09:                 Atone together.
      13181: 2019/09/09:               Good Duke, receive thy daughter;
      13182: 2019/09/09:               Hymen from heaven brought her,
      13183: 2019/09/09:                 Yea, brought her hither,
      13184: 2019/09/09:               That thou mightst join her hand with his,
      13185: 2019/09/09:               Whose heart within his bosom is.
      13186: 2019/09/09:   ROSALIND. [To DUKE] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
      13187: 2019/09/09:     [To ORLANDO] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
      13188: 2019/09/09:   DUKE SENIOR. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.  
      13189: 2019/09/09:   ORLANDO. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
      13190: 2019/09/09:   PHEBE. If sight and shape be true,
      13191: 2019/09/09:     Why then, my love adieu!
      13192: 2019/09/09:   ROSALIND. I'll have no father, if you be not he;
      13193: 2019/09/09:     I'll have no husband, if you be not he;
      13194: 2019/09/09:     Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
      13195: 2019/09/09:   HYMEN.    Peace, ho! I bar confusion;
      13196: 2019/09/09:             'Tis I must make conclusion
      13197: 2019/09/09:               Of these most strange events.
      13198: 2019/09/09:             Here's eight that must take hands
      13199: 2019/09/09:             To join in Hymen's bands,
      13200: 2019/09/10:               If truth holds true contents.
      13201: 2019/09/10:             You and you no cross shall part;
      13202: 2019/09/10:             You and you are heart in heart;
      13203: 2019/09/10:             You to his love must accord,
      13204: 2019/09/10:             Or have a woman to your lord;
      13205: 2019/09/10:             You and you are sure together,
      13206: 2019/09/10:             As the winter to foul weather.
      13207: 2019/09/10:             Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
      13208: 2019/09/10:             Feed yourselves with questioning,  
      13209: 2019/09/10:             That reason wonder may diminish,
      13210: 2019/09/10:             How thus we met, and these things finish.
      13211: 2019/09/10: 
      13212: 2019/09/10:                        SONG
      13213: 2019/09/10:             Wedding is great Juno's crown;
      13214: 2019/09/10:               O blessed bond of board and bed!
      13215: 2019/09/10:             'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
      13216: 2019/09/10:               High wedlock then be honoured.
      13217: 2019/09/10:             Honour, high honour, and renown,
      13218: 2019/09/10:             To Hymen, god of every town!
      13219: 2019/09/10: 
      13220: 2019/09/10:   DUKE SENIOR. O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
      13221: 2019/09/10:     Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
      13222: 2019/09/10:   PHEBE. I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
      13223: 2019/09/10:     Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
      13224: 2019/09/10: 
      13225: 2019/09/10:                  Enter JAQUES de BOYS
      13226: 2019/09/10: 
      13227: 2019/09/10:   JAQUES de BOYS. Let me have audience for a word or two.
      13228: 2019/09/10:     I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,  
      13229: 2019/09/10:     That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
      13230: 2019/09/10:     Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
      13231: 2019/09/10:     Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
      13232: 2019/09/10:     Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
      13233: 2019/09/10:     In his own conduct, purposely to take
      13234: 2019/09/10:     His brother here, and put him to the sword;
      13235: 2019/09/10:     And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
      13236: 2019/09/10:     Where, meeting with an old religious man,
      13237: 2019/09/10:     After some question with him, was converted
      13238: 2019/09/10:     Both from his enterprise and from the world;
      13239: 2019/09/10:     His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
      13240: 2019/09/10:     And all their lands restor'd to them again
      13241: 2019/09/10:     That were with him exil'd. This to be true
      13242: 2019/09/10:     I do engage my life.
      13243: 2019/09/10:   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, young man.
      13244: 2019/09/10:     Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
      13245: 2019/09/10:     To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,
      13246: 2019/09/10:     A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
      13247: 2019/09/10:     First, in this forest let us do those ends
      13248: 2019/09/10:     That here were well begun and well begot;  
      13249: 2019/09/10:     And after, every of this happy number,
      13250: 2019/09/10:     That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,
      13251: 2019/09/10:     Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
      13252: 2019/09/10:     According to the measure of their states.
      13253: 2019/09/10:     Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
      13254: 2019/09/10:     And fall into our rustic revelry.
      13255: 2019/09/10:     Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,
      13256: 2019/09/10:     With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.
      13257: 2019/09/10:   JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
      13258: 2019/09/10:     The Duke hath put on a religious life,
      13259: 2019/09/10:     And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
      13260: 2019/09/10:   JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.
      13261: 2019/09/10:   JAQUES. To him will I. Out of these convertites
      13262: 2019/09/10:     There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
      13263: 2019/09/10:     [To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath;
      13264: 2019/09/10:     Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
      13265: 2019/09/10:     [To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit;
      13266: 2019/09/10:     [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies
      13267: 2019/09/10:     [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed;
      13268: 2019/09/10:     [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage  
      13269: 2019/09/10:     Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;
      13270: 2019/09/10:     I am for other than for dancing measures.
      13271: 2019/09/10:   DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.
      13272: 2019/09/10:   JAQUES. To see no pastime I. What you would have
      13273: 2019/09/10:     I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.               Exit
      13274: 2019/09/10:   DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proceed. We will begin these rites,
      13275: 2019/09/10:     As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.    [A dance] Exeunt
      13276: 2019/09/10: 
      13277: 2019/09/10: EPILOGUE
      13278: 2019/09/10:                            EPILOGUE.
      13279: 2019/09/10:   ROSALIND. It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but
      13280: 2019/09/10:     it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it
      13281: 2019/09/10:     be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play
      13282: 2019/09/10:     needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and
      13283: 2019/09/10:     good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a
      13284: 2019/09/10:     case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot
      13285: 2019/09/10:     insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
      13286: 2019/09/10:     furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My
      13287: 2019/09/10:     way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge
      13288: 2019/09/10:     you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of
      13289: 2019/09/10:     this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love
      13290: 2019/09/10:     you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you
      13291: 2019/09/10:     hates them- that between you and the women the play may please.
      13292: 2019/09/10:     If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that
      13293: 2019/09/10:     pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied
      13294: 2019/09/10:     not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,
      13295: 2019/09/10:     or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,
      13296: 2019/09/10:     bid me farewell.
      13297: 2019/09/10:

      13371: 2019/09/11: 
      13372: 2019/09/11: A hall in the DUKE'S palace
      13373: 2019/09/11: 
      13374: 2019/09/11: Enter the DUKE OF EPHESUS, AEGEON, the Merchant
      13375: 2019/09/11: of Syracuse, GAOLER, OFFICERS, and other ATTENDANTS
      13376: 2019/09/11: 
      13377: 2019/09/11: AEGEON. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
      13378: 2019/09/11:   And by the doom of death end woes and all.
      13379: 2019/09/11: DUKE. Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
      13380: 2019/09/11:   I am not partial to infringe our laws.
      13381: 2019/09/11:   The enmity and discord which of late
      13382: 2019/09/11:   Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
      13383: 2019/09/11:   To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
      13384: 2019/09/11:   Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
      13385: 2019/09/11:   Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
      13386: 2019/09/11:   Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.
      13387: 2019/09/11:   For, since the mortal and intestine jars
      13388: 2019/09/11:   'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
      13389: 2019/09/11:   It hath in solemn synods been decreed,
      13390: 2019/09/11:   Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
      13391: 2019/09/11:   To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
      13392: 2019/09/11:   Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus
      13393: 2019/09/11:   Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
      13394: 2019/09/11:   Again, if any Syracusian born
      13395: 2019/09/11:   Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies,
      13396: 2019/09/11:   His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose,
      13397: 2019/09/11:   Unless a thousand marks be levied,
      13398: 2019/09/11:   To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
      13399: 2019/09/11:   Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
      13400: 2019/09/12:   Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
      13401: 2019/09/12:   Therefore by law thou art condemn'd to die.
      13402: 2019/09/12: AEGEON. Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
      13403: 2019/09/12:   My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
      13404: 2019/09/12: DUKE. Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
      13405: 2019/09/12:   Why thou departed'st from thy native home,
      13406: 2019/09/12:   And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.
      13407: 2019/09/12: AEGEON. A heavier task could not have been impos'd
      13408: 2019/09/12:   Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;
      13409: 2019/09/12:   Yet, that the world may witness that my end
      13410: 2019/09/12:   Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
      13411: 2019/09/12:   I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
      13412: 2019/09/12:   In Syracuse was I born, and wed
      13413: 2019/09/12:   Unto a woman, happy but for me,
      13414: 2019/09/12:   And by me, had not our hap been bad.
      13415: 2019/09/12:   With her I liv'd in joy; our wealth increas'd
      13416: 2019/09/12:   By prosperous voyages I often made
      13417: 2019/09/12:   To Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
      13418: 2019/09/12:   And the great care of goods at random left,
      13419: 2019/09/12:   Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
      13420: 2019/09/12:   From whom my absence was not six months old,
      13421: 2019/09/12:   Before herself, almost at fainting under
      13422: 2019/09/12:   The pleasing punishment that women bear,
      13423: 2019/09/12:   Had made provision for her following me,
      13424: 2019/09/12:   And soon and safe arrived where I was.
      13425: 2019/09/12:   There had she not been long but she became
      13426: 2019/09/12:   A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
      13427: 2019/09/12:   And, which was strange, the one so like the other
      13428: 2019/09/12:   As could not be disdnguish'd but by names.
      13429: 2019/09/12:   That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
      13430: 2019/09/12:   A mean woman was delivered
      13431: 2019/09/12:   Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
      13432: 2019/09/12:   Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
      13433: 2019/09/12:   I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.
      13434: 2019/09/12:   My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
      13435: 2019/09/12:   Made daily motions for our home return;
      13436: 2019/09/12:   Unwilling, I agreed. Alas! too soon
      13437: 2019/09/12:   We came aboard.
      13438: 2019/09/12:   A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
      13439: 2019/09/12:   Before the always-wind-obeying deep
      13440: 2019/09/12:   Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
      13441: 2019/09/12:   But longer did we not retain much hope,
      13442: 2019/09/12:   For what obscured light the heavens did grant
      13443: 2019/09/12:   Did but convey unto our fearful minds
      13444: 2019/09/12:   A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
      13445: 2019/09/12:   Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd,
      13446: 2019/09/12:   Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
      13447: 2019/09/12:   Weeping before for what she saw must come,
      13448: 2019/09/12:   And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
      13449: 2019/09/12:   That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
      13450: 2019/09/12:   Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me.
      13451: 2019/09/12:   And this it was, for other means was none:
      13452: 2019/09/12:   The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
      13453: 2019/09/12:   And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;
      13454: 2019/09/12:   My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
      13455: 2019/09/12:   Had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast,
      13456: 2019/09/12:   Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;
      13457: 2019/09/12:   To him one of the other twins was bound,
      13458: 2019/09/12:   Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
      13459: 2019/09/12:   The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,
      13460: 2019/09/12:   Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
      13461: 2019/09/12:   Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast,
      13462: 2019/09/12:   And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
      13463: 2019/09/12:   Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
      13464: 2019/09/12:   At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
      13465: 2019/09/12:   Dispers'd those vapours that offended us;
      13466: 2019/09/12:   And, by the benefit of his wished light,
      13467: 2019/09/12:   The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
      13468: 2019/09/12:   Two ships from far making amain to us-
      13469: 2019/09/12:   Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
      13470: 2019/09/12:   But ere they came-O, let me say no more!
      13471: 2019/09/12:   Gather the sequel by that went before.
      13472: 2019/09/12: DUKE. Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so;
      13473: 2019/09/12:   For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
      13474: 2019/09/12: AEGEON. O, had the gods done so, I had not now
      13475: 2019/09/12:   Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
      13476: 2019/09/12:   For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
      13477: 2019/09/12:   We were encount'red by a mighty rock,
      13478: 2019/09/12:   Which being violently borne upon,
      13479: 2019/09/12:   Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
      13480: 2019/09/12:   So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
      13481: 2019/09/12:   Fortune had left to both of us alike
      13482: 2019/09/12:   What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
      13483: 2019/09/12:   Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened
      13484: 2019/09/12:   With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,
      13485: 2019/09/12:   Was carried with more speed before the wind;
      13486: 2019/09/12:   And in our sight they three were taken up
      13487: 2019/09/12:   By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
      13488: 2019/09/12:   At length another ship had seiz'd on us;
      13489: 2019/09/12:   And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
      13490: 2019/09/12:   Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck'd guests,
      13491: 2019/09/12:   And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
      13492: 2019/09/12:   Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
      13493: 2019/09/12:   And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
      13494: 2019/09/12:   Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,
      13495: 2019/09/12:   That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
      13496: 2019/09/12:   To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
      13497: 2019/09/12: DUKE. And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
      13498: 2019/09/12:   Do me the favour to dilate at full
      13499: 2019/09/12:   What have befall'n of them and thee till now.
      13500: 2019/09/13: AEGEON. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
      13501: 2019/09/13:   At eighteen years became inquisitive
      13502: 2019/09/13:   After his brother, and importun'd me
      13503: 2019/09/13:   That his attendant-so his case was like,
      13504: 2019/09/13:   Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-
      13505: 2019/09/13:   Might bear him company in the quest of him;
      13506: 2019/09/13:   Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,
      13507: 2019/09/13:   I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd.
      13508: 2019/09/13:   Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,
      13509: 2019/09/13:   Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
      13510: 2019/09/13:   And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
      13511: 2019/09/13:   Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
      13512: 2019/09/13:   Or that or any place that harbours men.
      13513: 2019/09/13:   But here must end the story of my life;
      13514: 2019/09/13:   And happy were I in my timely death,
      13515: 2019/09/13:   Could all my travels warrant me they live.
      13516: 2019/09/13: DUKE. Hapless, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd
      13517: 2019/09/13:   To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
      13518: 2019/09/13:   Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
      13519: 2019/09/13:   Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
      13520: 2019/09/13:   Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
      13521: 2019/09/13:   My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
      13522: 2019/09/13:   But though thou art adjudged to the death,
      13523: 2019/09/13:   And passed sentence may not be recall'd
      13524: 2019/09/13:   But to our honour's great disparagement,
      13525: 2019/09/13:   Yet will I favour thee in what I can.
      13526: 2019/09/13:   Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
      13527: 2019/09/13:   To seek thy help by beneficial hap.
      13528: 2019/09/13:   Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
      13529: 2019/09/13:   Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
      13530: 2019/09/13:   And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
      13531: 2019/09/13:   Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
      13532: 2019/09/13: GAOLER. I will, my lord.
      13533: 2019/09/13: AEGEON. Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,
      13534: 2019/09/13:   But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
      13535: 2019/09/13: <Exeunt
      13536: 2019/09/13: 
      13537: 2019/09/13: 
      13538: 2019/09/13: SCENE 2
      13539: 2019/09/13: 
      13540: 2019/09/13: The mart
      13541: 2019/09/13: 
      13542: 2019/09/13: Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and FIRST MERCHANT
      13543: 2019/09/13: 
      13544: 2019/09/13: FIRST MERCHANT. Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,
      13545: 2019/09/13:   Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
      13546: 2019/09/13:   This very day a Syracusian merchant
      13547: 2019/09/13:   Is apprehended for arrival here;
      13548: 2019/09/13:   And, not being able to buy out his life,
      13549: 2019/09/13:   According to the statute of the town,
      13550: 2019/09/13:   Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
      13551: 2019/09/13:   There is your money that I had to keep.
      13552: 2019/09/13: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.
      13553: 2019/09/13:   And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
      13554: 2019/09/13:   Within this hour it will be dinner-time;
      13555: 2019/09/13:   Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
      13556: 2019/09/13:   Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
      13557: 2019/09/13:   And then return and sleep within mine inn;
      13558: 2019/09/13:   For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
      13559: 2019/09/13:   Get thee away.
      13560: 2019/09/13: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Many a man would take you at your word,
      13561: 2019/09/13:   And go indeed, having so good a mean.
      13562: 2019/09/13: <Exit
      13563: 2019/09/13: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
      13564: 2019/09/13:   When I am dull with care and melancholy,
      13565: 2019/09/13:   Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
      13566: 2019/09/13:   What, will you walk with me about the town,
      13567: 2019/09/13:   And then go to my inn and dine with me?
      13568: 2019/09/13: FIRST MERCHANT. I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
      13569: 2019/09/13:   Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
      13570: 2019/09/13:   I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
      13571: 2019/09/13:   Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart,
      13572: 2019/09/13:   And afterward consort you till bed time.
      13573: 2019/09/13:   My present business calls me from you now.
      13574: 2019/09/13: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
      13575: 2019/09/13:   And wander up and down to view the city.
      13576: 2019/09/13: FIRST MERCHANT. Sir, I commend you to your own content.
      13577: 2019/09/13: <Exit FIRST MERCHANT
      13578: 2019/09/13: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content
      13579: 2019/09/13:   Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
      13580: 2019/09/13:   I to the world am like a drop of water
      13581: 2019/09/13:   That in the ocean seeks another drop,
      13582: 2019/09/13:   Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
      13583: 2019/09/13:   Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.
      13584: 2019/09/13:   So I, to find a mother and a brother,
      13585: 2019/09/13:   In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
      13586: 2019/09/13: 
      13587: 2019/09/13: Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS
      13588: 2019/09/13: 
      13589: 2019/09/13:   Here comes the almanac of my true date.
      13590: 2019/09/13:   What now? How chance thou art return'd so soon?
      13591: 2019/09/13: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late.
      13592: 2019/09/13:   The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;
      13593: 2019/09/13:   The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell-
      13594: 2019/09/13:   My mistress made it one upon my cheek;
      13595: 2019/09/13:   She is so hot because the meat is cold,
      13596: 2019/09/13:   The meat is cold because you come not home,
      13597: 2019/09/13:   You come not home because you have no stomach,
      13598: 2019/09/13:   You have no stomach, having broke your fast;
      13599: 2019/09/13:   But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,
      13600: 2019/09/14:   Are penitent for your default to-day.
      13601: 2019/09/14: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
      13602: 2019/09/14:   Where have you left the money that I gave you?
      13603: 2019/09/14: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O-Sixpence that I had a Wednesday last
      13604: 2019/09/14:   To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
      13605: 2019/09/14:   The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
      13606: 2019/09/14: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
      13607: 2019/09/14:   Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
      13608: 2019/09/14:   We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
      13609: 2019/09/14:   So great a charge from thine own custody?
      13610: 2019/09/14: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.
      13611: 2019/09/14:   I from my mistress come to you in post;
      13612: 2019/09/14:   If I return, I shall be post indeed,
      13613: 2019/09/14:   For she will score your fault upon my pate.
      13614: 2019/09/14:   Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
      13615: 2019/09/14:   And strike you home without a messenger.
      13616: 2019/09/14: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
      13617: 2019/09/14:   Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
      13618: 2019/09/14:   Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
      13619: 2019/09/14: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.
      13620: 2019/09/14:   ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
      13621: 2019/09/14:   And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.
      13622: 2019/09/14: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
      13623: 2019/09/14:   Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.
      13624: 2019/09/14:   My mistress and her sister stays for you.
      13625: 2019/09/14: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
      13626: 2019/09/14:   In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
      13627: 2019/09/14:   Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
      13628: 2019/09/14:   That stands on tricks when I am undispos'd.
      13629: 2019/09/14:   Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
      13630: 2019/09/14: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
      13631: 2019/09/14:   Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
      13632: 2019/09/14:   But not a thousand marks between you both.
      13633: 2019/09/14:   If I should pay your worship those again,
      13634: 2019/09/14:   Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
      13635: 2019/09/14: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
      13636: 2019/09/14: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
      13637: 2019/09/14:   She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
      13638: 2019/09/14:   And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
      13639: 2019/09/14: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
      13640: 2019/09/14:   Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
      13641: 2019/09/14: [Beats him]
      13642: 2019/09/14: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What mean you, sir? For God's sake hold your hands!
      13643: 2019/09/14:   Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
      13644: 2019/09/14: <Exit
      13645: 2019/09/14: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other
      13646: 2019/09/14:   The villain is o'erraught of all my money.
      13647: 2019/09/14:   They say this town is full of cozenage;
      13648: 2019/09/14:   As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
      13649: 2019/09/14:   Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
      13650: 2019/09/14:   Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
      13651: 2019/09/14:   Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
      13652: 2019/09/14:   And many such-like liberties of sin;
      13653: 2019/09/14:   If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
      13654: 2019/09/14:   I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.
      13655: 2019/09/14:   I greatly fear my money is not safe.
      13656: 2019/09/14: <Exit

      13673: 2019/09/14: 
      13674: 2019/09/14: The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
      13675: 2019/09/14: 
      13676: 2019/09/14: Enter ADRIANA, wife to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, with LUCIANA, her sister
      13677: 2019/09/14: 
      13678: 2019/09/14: ADRIANA. Neither my husband nor the slave return'd
      13679: 2019/09/14:   That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
      13680: 2019/09/14:   Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
      13681: 2019/09/14: LUCIANA. Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
      13682: 2019/09/14:   And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner;
      13683: 2019/09/14:   Good sister, let us dine, and never fret.
      13684: 2019/09/14:   A man is master of his liberty;
      13685: 2019/09/14:   Time is their master, and when they see time,
      13686: 2019/09/14:   They'll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.
      13687: 2019/09/14: ADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?
      13688: 2019/09/14: LUCIANA. Because their business still lies out o' door.
      13689: 2019/09/14: ADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
      13690: 2019/09/14: LUCIANA. O, know he is the bridle of your will.
      13691: 2019/09/14: ADRIANA. There's none but asses will be bridled so.
      13692: 2019/09/14: LUCIANA. Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
      13693: 2019/09/14:   There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
      13694: 2019/09/14:   But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky.
      13695: 2019/09/14:   The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
      13696: 2019/09/14:   Are their males' subjects, and at their controls.
      13697: 2019/09/14:   Man, more divine, the master of all these,
      13698: 2019/09/14:   Lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas,
      13699: 2019/09/14:   Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls,
      13700: 2019/09/15:   Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
      13701: 2019/09/15:   Are masters to their females, and their lords;
      13702: 2019/09/15:   Then let your will attend on their accords.
      13703: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
      13704: 2019/09/15: LUCIANA. Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
      13705: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
      13706: 2019/09/15: LUCIANA. Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
      13707: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?
      13708: 2019/09/15: LUCIANA. Till he come home again, I would forbear.
      13709: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause:
      13710: 2019/09/15:   They can be meek that have no other cause.
      13711: 2019/09/15:   A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
      13712: 2019/09/15:   We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
      13713: 2019/09/15:   But were we burd'ned with like weight of pain,
      13714: 2019/09/15:   As much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
      13715: 2019/09/15:   So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
      13716: 2019/09/15:   With urging helpless patience would relieve me;
      13717: 2019/09/15:   But if thou live to see like right bereft,
      13718: 2019/09/15:   This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
      13719: 2019/09/15: LUCIANA. Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
      13720: 2019/09/15:   Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.
      13721: 2019/09/15: 
      13722: 2019/09/15: Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS
      13723: 2019/09/15: 
      13724: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
      13725: 2019/09/15: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two
      13726: 2019/09/15:   ears can witness.
      13727: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind?
      13728: 2019/09/15: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
      13729: 2019/09/15:   Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
      13730: 2019/09/15: LUCIANA. Spake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning?
      13731: 2019/09/15: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he struck so plainly I could to
      13732: 2019/09/15:   well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could
      13733: 2019/09/15:   scarce understand them.
      13734: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
      13735: 2019/09/15:   It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
      13736: 2019/09/15: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
      13737: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou villain!
      13738: 2019/09/15: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I mean not cuckold-mad;
      13739: 2019/09/15:   But, sure, he is stark mad.
      13740: 2019/09/15:   When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,
      13741: 2019/09/15:   He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
      13742: 2019/09/15:   "Tis dinner time' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
      13743: 2019/09/15:   'Your meat doth burn' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
      13744: 2019/09/15:   'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
      13745: 2019/09/15:   'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
      13746: 2019/09/15:   'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
      13747: 2019/09/15:   'My mistress, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress;
      13748: 2019/09/15:   I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress.'
      13749: 2019/09/15: LUCIANA. Quoth who?
      13750: 2019/09/15: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Quoth my master.
      13751: 2019/09/15:   'I know' quoth he 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
      13752: 2019/09/15:   So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
      13753: 2019/09/15:   I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
      13754: 2019/09/15:   For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
      13755: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
      13756: 2019/09/15: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Go back again, and be new beaten home?
      13757: 2019/09/15:   For God's sake, send some other messenger.
      13758: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
      13759: 2019/09/15: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And he will bless that cross with other beating;
      13760: 2019/09/15:   Between you I shall have a holy head.
      13761: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.
      13762: 2019/09/15: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Am I so round with you, as you with me,
      13763: 2019/09/15:   That like a football you do spurn me thus?
      13764: 2019/09/15:   You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither;
      13765: 2019/09/15:   If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
      13766: 2019/09/15: <Exit
      13767: 2019/09/15: LUCIANA. Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!
      13768: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace,
      13769: 2019/09/15:   Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
      13770: 2019/09/15:   Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took
      13771: 2019/09/15:   From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.
      13772: 2019/09/15:   Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?
      13773: 2019/09/15:   If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
      13774: 2019/09/15:   Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.
      13775: 2019/09/15:   Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
      13776: 2019/09/15:   That's not my fault; he's master of my state.
      13777: 2019/09/15:   What ruins are in me that can be found
      13778: 2019/09/15:   By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
      13779: 2019/09/15:   Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
      13780: 2019/09/15:   A sunny look of his would soon repair.
      13781: 2019/09/15:   But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,
      13782: 2019/09/15:   And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
      13783: 2019/09/15: LUCIANA. Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.
      13784: 2019/09/15: ADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
      13785: 2019/09/15:   I know his eye doth homage otherwhere;
      13786: 2019/09/15:   Or else what lets it but he would be here?
      13787: 2019/09/15:   Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain;
      13788: 2019/09/15:   Would that alone a love he would detain,
      13789: 2019/09/15:   So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
      13790: 2019/09/15:   I see the jewel best enamelled
      13791: 2019/09/15:   Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still
      13792: 2019/09/15:   That others touch and, often touching, will
      13793: 2019/09/15:   Where gold; and no man that hath a name
      13794: 2019/09/15:   By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
      13795: 2019/09/15:   Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
      13796: 2019/09/15:   I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
      13797: 2019/09/15: LUCIANA. How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
      13798: 2019/09/15: <Exeunt
      13799: 2019/09/15: 
      13800: 2019/09/16: 
      13801: 2019/09/16: SCENE 2
      13802: 2019/09/16: 
      13803: 2019/09/16: The mart
      13804: 2019/09/16: 
      13805: 2019/09/16: Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
      13806: 2019/09/16: 
      13807: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
      13808: 2019/09/16:   Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave
      13809: 2019/09/16:   Is wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
      13810: 2019/09/16:   By computation and mine host's report
      13811: 2019/09/16:   I could not speak with Dromio since at first
      13812: 2019/09/16:   I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
      13813: 2019/09/16: 
      13814: 2019/09/16: Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
      13815: 2019/09/16: 
      13816: 2019/09/16:   How now, sir, is your merry humour alter'd?
      13817: 2019/09/16:   As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
      13818: 2019/09/16:   You know no Centaur! You receiv'd no gold!
      13819: 2019/09/16:   Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner!
      13820: 2019/09/16:   My house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
      13821: 2019/09/16:   That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
      13822: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?
      13823: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
      13824: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I did not see you since you sent me hence,
      13825: 2019/09/16:   Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
      13826: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
      13827: 2019/09/16:   And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
      13828: 2019/09/16:   For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.
      13829: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am glad to see you in this merry vein.
      13830: 2019/09/16:   What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
      13831: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
      13832: 2019/09/16:   Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
      13833: 2019/09/16: [Beating him]
      13834: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Hold, sir, for God's sake! Now your jest is earnest.
      13835: 2019/09/16:   Upon what bargain do you give it me?
      13836: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes
      13837: 2019/09/16:   Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
      13838: 2019/09/16:   Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
      13839: 2019/09/16:   And make a common of my serious hours.
      13840: 2019/09/16:   When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
      13841: 2019/09/16:   But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
      13842: 2019/09/16:   If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
      13843: 2019/09/16:   And fashion your demeanour to my looks,
      13844: 2019/09/16:   Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
      13845: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sconce, call you it? So you would
      13846: 2019/09/16:   leave battering, I had rather have it a head. An you use
      13847: 2019/09/16:   these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and
      13848: 2019/09/16:   insconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
      13849: 2019/09/16:   But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?
      13850: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
      13851: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
      13852: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
      13853: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say
      13854: 2019/09/16:   every why hath a wherefore.
      13855: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
      13856: 2019/09/16:   For urging it the second time to me.
      13857: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
      13858: 2019/09/16:   When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?
      13859: 2019/09/16:   Well, sir, I thank you.
      13860: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
      13861: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, for this something that you gave
      13862: 2019/09/16:   me for nothing.
      13863: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
      13864: 2019/09/16:   give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinnertime?
      13865: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
      13866: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
      13867: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Basting.
      13868: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
      13869: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.
      13870: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
      13871: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me
      13872: 2019/09/16:   another dry basting.
      13873: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
      13874: 2019/09/16:   there's a time for all things.
      13875: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I durst have denied that, before you
      13876: 2019/09/16:   were so choleric.
      13877: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
      13878: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the
      13879: 2019/09/16:   plain bald pate of Father Time himself.
      13880: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
      13881: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There's no time for a man to recover
      13882: 2019/09/16:   his hair that grows bald by nature.
      13883: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
      13884: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and
      13885: 2019/09/16:   recover the lost hair of another man.
      13886: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of
      13887: 2019/09/16:   hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
      13888: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Because it is a blessing that he bestows
      13889: 2019/09/16:   on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath
      13890: 2019/09/16:   given them in wit.
      13891: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man
      13892: 2019/09/16:   hath more hair than wit.
      13893: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not a man of those but he hath the
      13894: 2019/09/16:   wit to lose his hair.
      13895: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
      13896: 2019/09/16:   men plain dealers without wit.
      13897: 2019/09/16: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost;
      13898: 2019/09/16:   yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
      13899: 2019/09/16: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
      13900: 2019/09/17: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. For two; and sound ones too.
      13901: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
      13902: 2019/09/17: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sure ones, then.
      13903: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
      13904: 2019/09/17: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Certain ones, then.
      13905: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
      13906: 2019/09/17: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The one, to save the money that he spends in
      13907: 2019/09/17:   tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his
      13908: 2019/09/17:   porridge.
      13909: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
      13910: 2019/09/17:   is no time for all things.
      13911: 2019/09/17: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover
      13912: 2019/09/17:   hair lost by nature.
      13913: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
      13914: 2019/09/17:   there is no time to recover.
      13915: 2019/09/17: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald,
      13916: 2019/09/17:   and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers.
      13917: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
      13918: 2019/09/17:   soft, who wafts us yonder?
      13919: 2019/09/17: 
      13920: 2019/09/17: Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
      13921: 2019/09/17: 
      13922: 2019/09/17: ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.
      13923: 2019/09/17:   Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
      13924: 2019/09/17:   I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
      13925: 2019/09/17:   The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
      13926: 2019/09/17:   That never words were music to thine ear,
      13927: 2019/09/17:   That never object pleasing in thine eye,
      13928: 2019/09/17:   That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
      13929: 2019/09/17:   That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,
      13930: 2019/09/17:   Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.
      13931: 2019/09/17:   How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
      13932: 2019/09/17:   That thou art then estranged from thyself?
      13933: 2019/09/17:   Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
      13934: 2019/09/17:   That, undividable, incorporate,
      13935: 2019/09/17:   Am better than thy dear self's better part.
      13936: 2019/09/17:   Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;
      13937: 2019/09/17:   For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
      13938: 2019/09/17:   A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
      13939: 2019/09/17:   And take unmingled thence that drop again
      13940: 2019/09/17:   Without addition or diminishing,
      13941: 2019/09/17:   As take from me thyself, and not me too.
      13942: 2019/09/17:   How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
      13943: 2019/09/17:   Should'st thou but hear I were licentious,
      13944: 2019/09/17:   And that this body, consecrate to thee,
      13945: 2019/09/17:   By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
      13946: 2019/09/17:   Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
      13947: 2019/09/17:   And hurl the name of husband in my face,
      13948: 2019/09/17:   And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
      13949: 2019/09/17:   And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,
      13950: 2019/09/17:   And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
      13951: 2019/09/17:   I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.
      13952: 2019/09/17:   I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
      13953: 2019/09/17:   My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
      13954: 2019/09/17:   For if we two be one, and thou play false,
      13955: 2019/09/17:   I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
      13956: 2019/09/17:   Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
      13957: 2019/09/17:   Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
      13958: 2019/09/17:   I live dis-stain'd, thou undishonoured.
      13959: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
      13960: 2019/09/17:   In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
      13961: 2019/09/17:   As strange unto your town as to your talk,
      13962: 2019/09/17:   Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
      13963: 2019/09/17:   Wants wit in all one word to understand.
      13964: 2019/09/17: LUCIANA. Fie, brother, how the world is chang'd with you!
      13965: 2019/09/17:   When were you wont to use my sister thus?
      13966: 2019/09/17:   She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
      13967: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
      13968: 2019/09/17: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By me?
      13969: 2019/09/17: ADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst return from him-
      13970: 2019/09/17:   That he did buffet thee, and in his blows
      13971: 2019/09/17:   Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
      13972: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
      13973: 2019/09/17:   What is the course and drift of your compact?
      13974: 2019/09/17: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, Sir? I never saw her till this time.
      13975: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
      13976: 2019/09/17:   Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
      13977: 2019/09/17: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I never spake with her in all my life.
      13978: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
      13979: 2019/09/17:   Unless it be by inspiration?
      13980: 2019/09/17: ADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity
      13981: 2019/09/17:   To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
      13982: 2019/09/17:   Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
      13983: 2019/09/17:   Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
      13984: 2019/09/17:   But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
      13985: 2019/09/17:   Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;
      13986: 2019/09/17:   Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
      13987: 2019/09/17:   Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
      13988: 2019/09/17:   Makes me with thy strength to communicate.
      13989: 2019/09/17:   If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
      13990: 2019/09/17:   Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
      13991: 2019/09/17:   Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion
      13992: 2019/09/17:   Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.
      13993: 2019/09/17: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
      13994: 2019/09/17:   What, was I married to her in my dream?
      13995: 2019/09/17:   Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
      13996: 2019/09/17:   What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
      13997: 2019/09/17:   Until I know this sure uncertainty,
      13998: 2019/09/17:   I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
      13999: 2019/09/17: LUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
      14000: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, for my beads! I cross me for sinner.
      14001: 2019/09/18:   This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!
      14002: 2019/09/18:   We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
      14003: 2019/09/18:   If we obey them not, this will ensue:
      14004: 2019/09/18:   They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
      14005: 2019/09/18: LUCIANA. Why prat'st thou to thyself, and answer'st not?
      14006: 2019/09/18:   Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
      14007: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am transformed, master, am not I?
      14008: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
      14009: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
      14010: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
      14011: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, I am an ape.
      14012: 2019/09/18: LUCIANA. If thou art chang'd to aught, 'tis to an ass.
      14013: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Tis true; she rides me, and I long for grass.
      14014: 2019/09/18:   'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
      14015: 2019/09/18:   But I should know her as well as she knows me.
      14016: 2019/09/18: ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
      14017: 2019/09/18:   To put the finger in the eye and weep,
      14018: 2019/09/18:   Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.
      14019: 2019/09/18:   Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
      14020: 2019/09/18:   Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day,
      14021: 2019/09/18:   And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
      14022: 2019/09/18:   Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
      14023: 2019/09/18:   Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
      14024: 2019/09/18:   Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
      14025: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
      14026: 2019/09/18:   Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advis'd?
      14027: 2019/09/18:   Known unto these, and to myself disguis'd!
      14028: 2019/09/18:   I'll say as they say, and persever so,
      14029: 2019/09/18:   And in this mist at all adventures go.
      14030: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
      14031: 2019/09/18: ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
      14032: 2019/09/18: LUCIANA. Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

      14050: 2019/09/18: 
      14051: 2019/09/18: Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
      14052: 2019/09/18: 
      14053: 2019/09/18: Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, DROMIO OF EPHESUS, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR
      14054: 2019/09/18: 
      14055: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
      14056: 2019/09/18:   My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
      14057: 2019/09/18:   Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
      14058: 2019/09/18:   To see the making of her carcanet,
      14059: 2019/09/18:   And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
      14060: 2019/09/18:   But here's a villain that would face me down
      14061: 2019/09/18:   He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
      14062: 2019/09/18:   And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,
      14063: 2019/09/18:   And that I did deny my wife and house.
      14064: 2019/09/18:   Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
      14065: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.
      14066: 2019/09/18:   That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;
      14067: 2019/09/18:   If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
      14068: 2019/09/18:   Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
      14069: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
      14070: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Marry, so it doth appear
      14071: 2019/09/18:   By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
      14072: 2019/09/18:   I should kick, being kick'd; and being at that pass,
      14073: 2019/09/18:   You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.
      14074: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer
      14075: 2019/09/18:   May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
      14076: 2019/09/18: BALTHAZAR. I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.
      14077: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
      14078: 2019/09/18:   A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
      14079: 2019/09/18: BALTHAZAR. Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
      14080: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing
      14081: 2019/09/18:   but words.
      14082: 2019/09/18: BALTHAZAR. Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
      14083: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
      14084: 2019/09/18:   But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
      14085: 2019/09/18:   Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
      14086: 2019/09/18:   But, soft, my door is lock'd; go bid them let us in.
      14087: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn!
      14088: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch!
      14089: 2019/09/18:   Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
      14090: 2019/09/18:   Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store,
      14091: 2019/09/18:   When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.
      14092: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What patch is made our porter?
      14093: 2019/09/18:   My master stays in the street.
      14094: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Let him walk from whence he came,
      14095: 2019/09/18:     lest he catch cold on's feet.
      14096: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
      14097: 2019/09/18: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Right, sir; I'll tell you when,
      14098: 2019/09/18:     an you'll tell me wherefore.
      14099: 2019/09/18: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;
      14100: 2019/09/19:     I have not din'd to-day.
      14101: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Nor to-day here you must not;
      14102: 2019/09/19:     come again when you may.
      14103: 2019/09/19: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
      14104: 2019/09/19:     from the house I owe?
      14105: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  The porter for this time,
      14106: 2019/09/19:     sir, and my name is Dromio.
      14107: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Villain, thou hast stol'n both mine
      14108: 2019/09/19:     office and my name!
      14109: 2019/09/19:   The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
      14110: 2019/09/19:   If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
      14111: 2019/09/19:   Thou wouldst have chang'd thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass.
      14112: 2019/09/19: 
      14113: 2019/09/19: Enter LUCE, within
      14114: 2019/09/19: 
      14115: 2019/09/19: LUCE.  [Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? Who are those at the gate?
      14116: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Let my master in, Luce.
      14117: 2019/09/19: LUCE.  [Within]  Faith, no, he comes too late;
      14118: 2019/09/19:   And so tell your master.
      14119: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Lord, I must laugh!
      14120: 2019/09/19:   Have at you with a proverb: Shall I set in my staff?
      14121: 2019/09/19: LUCE.  [Within]  Have at you with another: that's-when? can you tell?
      14122: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  If thy name be called Luce
      14123: 2019/09/19:     -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.
      14124: 2019/09/19: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
      14125: 2019/09/19: LUCE.  [Within]  I thought to have ask'd you.
      14126: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  And you said no.
      14127: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. SO, Come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
      14128: 2019/09/19: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
      14129: 2019/09/19: LUCE.  [Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?
      14130: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, knock the door hard.
      14131: 2019/09/19: LUCE.  [Within]  Let him knock till it ache.
      14132: 2019/09/19: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down.
      14133: 2019/09/19: LUCE.  [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
      14134: 2019/09/19: 
      14135: 2019/09/19: Enter ADRIANA, within
      14136: 2019/09/19: 
      14137: 2019/09/19: ADRIANA.  [Within]  Who is that at the door, that keeps all this noise?
      14138: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  By my troth, your town is
      14139: 2019/09/19:     troubled with unruly boys.
      14140: 2019/09/19: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might
      14141: 2019/09/19:     have come before.
      14142: 2019/09/19: ADRIANA.  [Within]  Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the door.
      14143: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. If YOU went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.
      14144: 2019/09/19: ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.
      14145: 2019/09/19: BALTHAZAR. In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
      14146: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
      14147: 2019/09/19: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
      14148: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
      14149: 2019/09/19:   Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold;
      14150: 2019/09/19:   It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
      14151: 2019/09/19: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate.
      14152: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Break any breaking here,
      14153: 2019/09/19:     and I'll break your knave's pate.
      14154: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A man may break a word with you,
      14155: 2019/09/19:     sir; and words are but wind;
      14156: 2019/09/19:   Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
      14157: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking;
      14158: 2019/09/19:     out upon thee, hind!
      14159: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's too much 'out upon thee!' pray thee let me in.
      14160: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Ay, when fowls have no
      14161: 2019/09/19:     feathers and fish have no fin.
      14162: 2019/09/19: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
      14163: 2019/09/19: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
      14164: 2019/09/19:   For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
      14165: 2019/09/19:   If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
      14166: 2019/09/19: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
      14167: 2019/09/19: BALTHAZAR. Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
      14168: 2019/09/19:   Herein you war against your reputation,
      14169: 2019/09/19:   And draw within the compass of suspect
      14170: 2019/09/19:   Th' unviolated honour of your wife.
      14171: 2019/09/19:   Once this-your long experience of her wisdom,
      14172: 2019/09/19:   Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,
      14173: 2019/09/19:   Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;
      14174: 2019/09/19:   And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
      14175: 2019/09/19:   Why at this time the doors are made against you.
      14176: 2019/09/19:   Be rul'd by me: depart in patience,
      14177: 2019/09/19:   And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;
      14178: 2019/09/19:   And, about evening, come yourself alone
      14179: 2019/09/19:   To know the reason of this strange restraint.
      14180: 2019/09/19:   If by strong hand you offer to break in
      14181: 2019/09/19:   Now in the stirring passage of the day,
      14182: 2019/09/19:   A vulgar comment will be made of it,
      14183: 2019/09/19:   And that supposed by the common rout
      14184: 2019/09/19:   Against your yet ungalled estimation
      14185: 2019/09/19:   That may with foul intrusion enter in
      14186: 2019/09/19:   And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
      14187: 2019/09/19:   For slander lives upon succession,
      14188: 2019/09/19:   For ever hous'd where it gets possession.
      14189: 2019/09/19: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
      14190: 2019/09/19:   And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.
      14191: 2019/09/19:   I know a wench of excellent discourse,
      14192: 2019/09/19:   Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;
      14193: 2019/09/19:   There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
      14194: 2019/09/19:   My wife-but, I protest, without desert-
      14195: 2019/09/19:   Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;
      14196: 2019/09/19:   To her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
      14197: 2019/09/19:   And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made.
      14198: 2019/09/19:   Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
      14199: 2019/09/19:   For there's the house. That chain will I bestow-
      14200: 2019/09/20:   Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-
      14201: 2019/09/20:   Upon mine hostess there; good sir, make haste.
      14202: 2019/09/20:   Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
      14203: 2019/09/20:   I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
      14204: 2019/09/20: ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
      14205: 2019/09/20: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
      14206: 2019/09/20: <Exeunt
      14207: 2019/09/20: 
      14208: 2019/09/20: 
      14209: 2019/09/20: SCENE 2
      14210: 2019/09/20: 
      14211: 2019/09/20: Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
      14212: 2019/09/20: 
      14213: 2019/09/20: Enter LUCIANA with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
      14214: 2019/09/20: 
      14215: 2019/09/20: LUCIANA. And may it be that you have quite forgot
      14216: 2019/09/20:   A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
      14217: 2019/09/20:   Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
      14218: 2019/09/20:   Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
      14219: 2019/09/20:   If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
      14220: 2019/09/20:   Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness;
      14221: 2019/09/20:   Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
      14222: 2019/09/20:   Muffle your false love with some show of blindness;
      14223: 2019/09/20:   Let not my sister read it in your eye;
      14224: 2019/09/20:   Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
      14225: 2019/09/20:   Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
      14226: 2019/09/20:   Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
      14227: 2019/09/20:   Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
      14228: 2019/09/20:   Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
      14229: 2019/09/20:   Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
      14230: 2019/09/20:   What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
      14231: 2019/09/20:   'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
      14232: 2019/09/20:   And let her read it in thy looks at board;
      14233: 2019/09/20:   Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
      14234: 2019/09/20:   Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.
      14235: 2019/09/20:   Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
      14236: 2019/09/20:   Being compact of credit, that you love us;
      14237: 2019/09/20:   Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
      14238: 2019/09/20:   We in your motion turn, and you may move us.
      14239: 2019/09/20:   Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
      14240: 2019/09/20:   Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.
      14241: 2019/09/20:   'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
      14242: 2019/09/20:   When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
      14243: 2019/09/20: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
      14244: 2019/09/20:   Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine-
      14245: 2019/09/20:   Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
      14246: 2019/09/20:   Than our earth's wonder-more than earth, divine.
      14247: 2019/09/20:   Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
      14248: 2019/09/20:   Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
      14249: 2019/09/20:   Smoth'red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
      14250: 2019/09/20:   The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
      14251: 2019/09/20:   Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
      14252: 2019/09/20:   To make it wander in an unknown field?
      14253: 2019/09/20:   Are you a god? Would you create me new?
      14254: 2019/09/20:   Transform me, then, and to your pow'r I'll yield.
      14255: 2019/09/20:   But if that I am I, then well I know
      14256: 2019/09/20:   Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
      14257: 2019/09/20:   Nor to her bed no homage do I owe;
      14258: 2019/09/20:   Far more, far more, to you do I decline.
      14259: 2019/09/20:   O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
      14260: 2019/09/20:   To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.
      14261: 2019/09/20:   Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;
      14262: 2019/09/20:   Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
      14263: 2019/09/20:   And as a bed I'll take them, and there he;
      14264: 2019/09/20:   And in that glorious supposition think
      14265: 2019/09/20:   He gains by death that hath such means to die.
      14266: 2019/09/20:   Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.
      14267: 2019/09/20: LUCIANA. What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
      14268: 2019/09/20: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
      14269: 2019/09/20: LUCIANA. It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
      14270: 2019/09/20: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
      14271: 2019/09/20: LUCIANA. Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
      14272: 2019/09/20: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
      14273: 2019/09/20: LUCIANA. Why call you me love? Call my sister so.
      14274: 2019/09/20: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
      14275: 2019/09/20: LUCIANA. That's my sister.
      14276: 2019/09/20: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
      14277: 2019/09/20:   It is thyself, mine own self's better part;
      14278: 2019/09/20:   Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
      14279: 2019/09/20:   My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
      14280: 2019/09/20:   My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
      14281: 2019/09/20: LUCIANA. All this my sister is, or else should be.
      14282: 2019/09/20: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
      14283: 2019/09/20:   Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;
      14284: 2019/09/20:   Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.
      14285: 2019/09/20:   Give me thy hand.
      14286: 2019/09/20: LUCIANA. O, soft, sir, hold you still;
      14287: 2019/09/20:   I'll fetch my sister to get her good will.
      14288: 2019/09/20: <Exit LUCIANA
      14289: 2019/09/20: 
      14290: 2019/09/20: Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
      14291: 2019/09/20: 
      14292: 2019/09/20: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
      14293: 2019/09/20:   so fast?
      14294: 2019/09/20: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio?
      14295: 2019/09/20:   Am I your man? Am I myself?
      14296: 2019/09/20: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
      14297: 2019/09/20:   man, thou art thyself.
      14298: 2019/09/20: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am an ass, I am a woman's man, and besides
      14299: 2019/09/20:   myself.
      14300: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
      14301: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due
      14302: 2019/09/21:   to a woman-one that claims me, one that haunts me, one
      14303: 2019/09/21:   that will have me.
      14304: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
      14305: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, such claim as you would
      14306: 2019/09/21:   lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not
      14307: 2019/09/21:   that, I being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
      14308: 2019/09/21:   being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
      14309: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
      14310: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A very reverent body; ay, such a one
      14311: 2019/09/21:   as a man may not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.'
      14312: 2019/09/21:   I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
      14313: 2019/09/21:   wondrous fat marriage.
      14314: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
      14315: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, she's the kitchen-wench,
      14316: 2019/09/21:   and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to but
      14317: 2019/09/21:   to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.
      14318: 2019/09/21:   I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn
      14319: 2019/09/21:   Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday, she'll burn
      14320: 2019/09/21:   week longer than the whole world.
      14321: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
      14322: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Swart, like my shoe; but her face
      14323: 2019/09/21:   nothing like so clean kept; for why, she sweats, a man may
      14324: 2019/09/21:   go over shoes in the grime of it.
      14325: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
      14326: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood
      14327: 2019/09/21:   could not do it.
      14328: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
      14329: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nell, sir; but her name and three
      14330: 2019/09/21:   quarters, that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure
      14331: 2019/09/21:   her from hip to hip.
      14332: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
      14333: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No longer from head to foot than
      14334: 2019/09/21:   from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find
      14335: 2019/09/21:   out countries in her.
      14336: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
      14337: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out by
      14338: 2019/09/21:   the bogs.
      14339: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
      14340: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I found it by the barrenness, hard in
      14341: 2019/09/21:   the palm of the hand.
      14342: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
      14343: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. In her forehead, arm'd and reverted,
      14344: 2019/09/21:   making war against her heir.
      14345: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
      14346: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I look'd for the chalky cliffs, but I
      14347: 2019/09/21:   could find no whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her
      14348: 2019/09/21:   chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
      14349: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
      14350: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in
      14351: 2019/09/21:   her breath.
      14352: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
      14353: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, sir, upon her nose, an o'er embellished with
      14354: 2019/09/21:   rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the
      14355: 2019/09/21:   hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be
      14356: 2019/09/21:   ballast at her nose.
      14357: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
      14358: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, Sir, I did not look so low. To
      14359: 2019/09/21:   conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me; call'd me
      14360: 2019/09/21:   Dromio; swore I was assur'd to her; told me what privy
      14361: 2019/09/21:   marks I had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the
      14362: 2019/09/21:   mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I,
      14363: 2019/09/21:   amaz'd, ran from her as a witch.
      14364: 2019/09/21:   And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith,
      14365: 2019/09/21:     and my heart of steel,
      14366: 2019/09/21:   She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i' th' wheel.
      14367: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
      14368: 2019/09/21:   An if the wind blow any way from shore,
      14369: 2019/09/21:   I will not harbour in this town to-night.
      14370: 2019/09/21:   If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
      14371: 2019/09/21:   Where I will walk till thou return to me.
      14372: 2019/09/21:   If every one knows us, and we know none,
      14373: 2019/09/21:   'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
      14374: 2019/09/21: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. As from a bear a man would run for life,
      14375: 2019/09/21:   So fly I from her that would be my wife.
      14376: 2019/09/21: <Exit
      14377: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
      14378: 2019/09/21:   And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
      14379: 2019/09/21:   She that doth call me husband, even my soul
      14380: 2019/09/21:   Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
      14381: 2019/09/21:   Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
      14382: 2019/09/21:   Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
      14383: 2019/09/21:   Hath almost made me traitor to myself;
      14384: 2019/09/21:   But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
      14385: 2019/09/21:   I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
      14386: 2019/09/21: 
      14387: 2019/09/21: Enter ANGELO with the chain
      14388: 2019/09/21: 
      14389: 2019/09/21: ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
      14390: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
      14391: 2019/09/21: ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
      14392: 2019/09/21:   I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine;
      14393: 2019/09/21:   The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
      14394: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
      14395: 2019/09/21: ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
      14396: 2019/09/21: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
      14397: 2019/09/21: ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
      14398: 2019/09/21:   Go home with it, and please your wife withal;
      14399: 2019/09/21:   And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
      14400: 2019/09/22:   And then receive my money for the chain.
      14401: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
      14402: 2019/09/22:   For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
      14403: 2019/09/22: ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
      14404: 2019/09/22: <Exit
      14405: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
      14406: 2019/09/22:   But this I think, there's no man is so vain
      14407: 2019/09/22:   That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
      14408: 2019/09/22:   I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
      14409: 2019/09/22:   When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
      14410: 2019/09/22:   I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;
      14411: 2019/09/22:   If any ship put out, then straight away.
      14412: 2019/09/22: <Exit

      14429: 2019/09/22: 
      14430: 2019/09/22: A public place
      14431: 2019/09/22: 
      14432: 2019/09/22: Enter SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO, and an OFFICER
      14433: 2019/09/22: 
      14434: 2019/09/22: SECOND MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
      14435: 2019/09/22:   And since I have not much importun'd you;
      14436: 2019/09/22:   Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
      14437: 2019/09/22:   To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
      14438: 2019/09/22:   Therefore make present satisfaction,
      14439: 2019/09/22:   Or I'll attach you by this officer.
      14440: 2019/09/22: ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
      14441: 2019/09/22:   Is growing to me by Antipholus;
      14442: 2019/09/22:   And in the instant that I met with you
      14443: 2019/09/22:   He had of me a chain; at five o'clock
      14444: 2019/09/22:   I shall receive the money for the same.
      14445: 2019/09/22:   Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
      14446: 2019/09/22:   I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.
      14447: 2019/09/22: 
      14448: 2019/09/22: Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS, from the COURTEZAN'S
      14449: 2019/09/22: 
      14450: 2019/09/22: OFFICER. That labour may you save; see where he comes.
      14451: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
      14452: 2019/09/22:   And buy a rope's end; that will I bestow
      14453: 2019/09/22:   Among my wife and her confederates,
      14454: 2019/09/22:   For locking me out of my doors by day.
      14455: 2019/09/22:   But, soft, I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
      14456: 2019/09/22:   Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.
      14457: 2019/09/22: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I buy a thousand pound a year; I buy a rope.
      14458: 2019/09/22: <Exit DROMIO
      14459: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
      14460: 2019/09/22:   I promised your presence and the chain;
      14461: 2019/09/22:   But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
      14462: 2019/09/22:   Belike you thought our love would last too long,
      14463: 2019/09/22:   If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
      14464: 2019/09/22: ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
      14465: 2019/09/22:   How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
      14466: 2019/09/22:   The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,
      14467: 2019/09/22:   Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
      14468: 2019/09/22:   Than I stand debted to this gentleman.
      14469: 2019/09/22:   I pray you see him presently discharg'd,
      14470: 2019/09/22:   For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.
      14471: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
      14472: 2019/09/22:   Besides, I have some business in the town.
      14473: 2019/09/22:   Good signior, take the stranger to my house,
      14474: 2019/09/22:   And with you take the chain, and bid my wife
      14475: 2019/09/22:   Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.
      14476: 2019/09/22:   Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
      14477: 2019/09/22: ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
      14478: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
      14479: 2019/09/22: ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
      14480: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
      14481: 2019/09/22:   Or else you may return without your money.
      14482: 2019/09/22: ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
      14483: 2019/09/22:   Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
      14484: 2019/09/22:   And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
      14485: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
      14486: 2019/09/22:   Your breach of promise to the Porpentine;
      14487: 2019/09/22:   I should have chid you for not bringing it,
      14488: 2019/09/22:   But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
      14489: 2019/09/22: SECOND MERCHANT. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.
      14490: 2019/09/22: ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
      14491: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
      14492: 2019/09/22: ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
      14493: 2019/09/22:   Either send the chain or send by me some token.
      14494: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
      14495: 2019/09/22:   Come, where's the chain? I pray you let me see it.
      14496: 2019/09/22: SECOND MERCHANT. My business cannot brook this dalliance.
      14497: 2019/09/22:   Good sir, say whe'r you'll answer me or no;
      14498: 2019/09/22:   If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
      14499: 2019/09/22: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
      14500: 2019/09/23: ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
      14501: 2019/09/23: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
      14502: 2019/09/23: ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
      14503: 2019/09/23: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
      14504: 2019/09/23: ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
      14505: 2019/09/23:   Consider how it stands upon my credit.
      14506: 2019/09/23: SECOND MERCHANT. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
      14507: 2019/09/23: OFFICER. I do; and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me.
      14508: 2019/09/23: ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
      14509: 2019/09/23:   Either consent to pay this sum for me,
      14510: 2019/09/23:   Or I attach you by this officer.
      14511: 2019/09/23: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
      14512: 2019/09/23:   Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar'st.
      14513: 2019/09/23: ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
      14514: 2019/09/23:   I would not spare my brother in this case,
      14515: 2019/09/23:   If he should scorn me so apparently.
      14516: 2019/09/23: OFFICER. I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.
      14517: 2019/09/23: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
      14518: 2019/09/23:   But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
      14519: 2019/09/23:   As all the metal in your shop will answer.
      14520: 2019/09/23: ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
      14521: 2019/09/23:   To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
      14522: 2019/09/23: 
      14523: 2019/09/23: Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, from the bay
      14524: 2019/09/23: 
      14525: 2019/09/23: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, there's a bark of Epidamnum
      14526: 2019/09/23:   That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
      14527: 2019/09/23:   And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
      14528: 2019/09/23:   I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
      14529: 2019/09/23:   The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitx.
      14530: 2019/09/23:   The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
      14531: 2019/09/23:   Blows fair from land; they stay for nought at an
      14532: 2019/09/23:   But for their owner, master, and yourself.
      14533: 2019/09/23: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
      14534: 2019/09/23:   What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
      14535: 2019/09/23: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
      14536: 2019/09/23: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
      14537: 2019/09/23:   And told thee to what purpose and what end.
      14538: 2019/09/23: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. YOU sent me for a rope's end as soon-
      14539: 2019/09/23:   You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
      14540: 2019/09/23: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
      14541: 2019/09/23:   And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
      14542: 2019/09/23:   To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
      14543: 2019/09/23:   Give her this key, and tell her in the desk
      14544: 2019/09/23:   That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry
      14545: 2019/09/23:   There is a purse of ducats; let her send it.
      14546: 2019/09/23:   Tell her I am arrested in the street,
      14547: 2019/09/23:   And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone.
      14548: 2019/09/23:   On, officer, to prison till it come.
      14549: 2019/09/23: <Exeunt all but DROMIO
      14550: 2019/09/23: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. To Adriana! that is where we din'd,
      14551: 2019/09/23:   Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.
      14552: 2019/09/23:   She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
      14553: 2019/09/23:   Thither I must, although against my will,
      14554: 2019/09/23:   For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

      14560: 2019/09/23: The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
      14561: 2019/09/23: 
      14562: 2019/09/23: Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
      14563: 2019/09/23: 
      14564: 2019/09/23: ADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
      14565: 2019/09/23:   Might'st thou perceive austerely in his eye
      14566: 2019/09/23:   That he did plead in earnest? Yea or no?
      14567: 2019/09/23:   Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
      14568: 2019/09/23:   What observation mad'st thou in this case
      14569: 2019/09/23:   Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
      14570: 2019/09/23: LUCIANA. First he denied you had in him no right.
      14571: 2019/09/23: ADRIANA. He meant he did me none-the more my spite.
      14572: 2019/09/23: LUCIANA. Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
      14573: 2019/09/23: ADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
      14574: 2019/09/23: LUCIANA. Then pleaded I for you.
      14575: 2019/09/23: ADRIANA. And what said he?
      14576: 2019/09/23: LUCIANA. That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
      14577: 2019/09/23: ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
      14578: 2019/09/23: LUCIANA. With words that in an honest suit might move.
      14579: 2019/09/23:   First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
      14580: 2019/09/23: ADRIANA. Didst speak him fair?
      14581: 2019/09/23: LUCIANA. Have patience, I beseech.
      14582: 2019/09/23: ADRIANA. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;
      14583: 2019/09/23:   My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
      14584: 2019/09/23:   He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
      14585: 2019/09/23:   Ill-fac'd, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
      14586: 2019/09/23:   Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
      14587: 2019/09/23:   Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
      14588: 2019/09/23: LUCIANA. Who would be jealous then of such a one?
      14589: 2019/09/23:   No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
      14590: 2019/09/23: ADRIANA. Ah, but I think him better than I say,
      14591: 2019/09/23:   And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
      14592: 2019/09/23:   Far from her nest the lapwing cries away;
      14593: 2019/09/23:   My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
      14594: 2019/09/23:

      14596: 2019/09/23: 
      14597: 2019/09/23: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Here go-the desk, the purse. Sweet
      14598: 2019/09/23:   now, make haste.
      14599: 2019/09/23: LUCIANA. How hast thou lost thy breath?
      14600: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By running fast.
      14601: 2019/09/24: ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?
      14602: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
      14603: 2019/09/24:   A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
      14604: 2019/09/24:   One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
      14605: 2019/09/24:   A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
      14606: 2019/09/24:   A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
      14607: 2019/09/24:   A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
      14608: 2019/09/24:   The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;
      14609: 2019/09/24:   A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
      14610: 2019/09/24:   One that, before the Judgment, carries poor souls to hell.
      14611: 2019/09/24: ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter?
      14612: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the matter; he is rested on the case.
      14613: 2019/09/24: ADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me, at whose suit?
      14614: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
      14615: 2019/09/24:   But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
      14616: 2019/09/24:   Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?
      14617: 2019/09/24: ADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister.  [Exit LUCIANA]  This I wonder at:
      14618: 2019/09/24:   Thus he unknown to me should be in debt.
      14619: 2019/09/24:   Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
      14620: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. on a band, but on a stronger thing,
      14621: 2019/09/24:   A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
      14622: 2019/09/24: ADRIANA. What, the chain?
      14623: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bell; 'tis time that I were gone.
      14624: 2019/09/24:   It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.
      14625: 2019/09/24: ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.
      14626: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O yes. If any hour meet a sergeant,
      14627: 2019/09/24:     'a turns back for very fear.
      14628: 2019/09/24: ADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason!
      14629: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Time is a very bankrupt, and owes
      14630: 2019/09/24:     more than he's worth to season.
      14631: 2019/09/24:   Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
      14632: 2019/09/24:   That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
      14633: 2019/09/24:   If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
      14634: 2019/09/24:   Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
      14635: 2019/09/24: 
      14636: 2019/09/24: Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse
      14637: 2019/09/24: 
      14638: 2019/09/24: ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight,
      14639: 2019/09/24:   And bring thy master home immediately.
      14640: 2019/09/24:   Come, sister; I am press'd down with conceit-
      14641: 2019/09/24:   Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

      14650: 2019/09/24: 
      14651: 2019/09/24: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
      14652: 2019/09/24:   As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
      14653: 2019/09/24:   And every one doth call me by my name.
      14654: 2019/09/24:   Some tender money to me, some invite me,
      14655: 2019/09/24:   Some other give me thanks for kindnesses,
      14656: 2019/09/24:   Some offer me commodities to buy;
      14657: 2019/09/24:   Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop,
      14658: 2019/09/24:   And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
      14659: 2019/09/24:   And therewithal took measure of my body.
      14660: 2019/09/24:   Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,
      14661: 2019/09/24:   And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
      14662: 2019/09/24: 
      14663: 2019/09/24: Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
      14664: 2019/09/24: 
      14665: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here's the gold you sent me
      14666: 2019/09/24:   for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparell'd?
      14667: 2019/09/24: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
      14668: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise,
      14669: 2019/09/24:   but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the
      14670: 2019/09/24:   calf's skin that was kill'd for the Prodigal; he that came behind
      14671: 2019/09/24:   you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.
      14672: 2019/09/24: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
      14673: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No? Why, 'tis a plain case: he that
      14674: 2019/09/24:   went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
      14675: 2019/09/24:   that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rest
      14676: 2019/09/24:   them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and give
      14677: 2019/09/24:   them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more
      14678: 2019/09/24:   exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.
      14679: 2019/09/24: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
      14680: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band;
      14681: 2019/09/24:   that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; on
      14682: 2019/09/24:   that thinks a man always going to bed, and says 'God give
      14683: 2019/09/24:   you good rest!'
      14684: 2019/09/24: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
      14685: 2019/09/24:   there any ship puts forth to-night? May we be gone?
      14686: 2019/09/24: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Why, sir, I brought you word an
      14687: 2019/09/24:   hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and
      14688: 2019/09/24:   then were you hind'red by the sergeant, to tarry for the
      14689: 2019/09/24:   boy Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you.
      14690: 2019/09/24: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
      14691: 2019/09/24:   And here we wander in illusions.
      14692: 2019/09/24:   Some blessed power deliver us from hence!

      14695: 2019/09/24: 
      14696: 2019/09/24: COURTEZAN. Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
      14697: 2019/09/24:   I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.
      14698: 2019/09/24:   Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
      14699: 2019/09/24: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
      14700: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, is this Mistress Satan?
      14701: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
      14702: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's
      14703: 2019/09/25:   dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench; and
      14704: 2019/09/25:   thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me!' That's
      14705: 2019/09/25:   as much to say 'God make me a light wench!' It is written
      14706: 2019/09/25:   they appear to men like angels of light; light is an effect
      14707: 2019/09/25:   of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, light wenches will burn.
      14708: 2019/09/25:   Come not near her.
      14709: 2019/09/25: COURTEZAN. Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
      14710: 2019/09/25:   Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here.
      14711: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat,
      14712: 2019/09/25:   or bespeak a long spoon.
      14713: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
      14714: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, he must have a long spoon
      14715: 2019/09/25:   that must eat with the devil.
      14716: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
      14717: 2019/09/25:   Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress;
      14718: 2019/09/25:   I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
      14719: 2019/09/25: COURTEZAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
      14720: 2019/09/25:   Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd,
      14721: 2019/09/25:   And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
      14722: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
      14723: 2019/09/25:   A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
      14724: 2019/09/25:   A nut, a cherry-stone;
      14725: 2019/09/25:   But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
      14726: 2019/09/25:   Master, be wise; an if you give it her,
      14727: 2019/09/25:   The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it.
      14728: 2019/09/25: COURTEZAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain;
      14729: 2019/09/25:   I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
      14730: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
      14731: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Fly pride' says the peacock. Mistress, that you know.
      14732: 2019/09/25: <Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
      14733: 2019/09/25: COURTEZAN. Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,
      14734: 2019/09/25:   Else would he never so demean himself.
      14735: 2019/09/25:   A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
      14736: 2019/09/25:   And for the same he promis'd me a chain;
      14737: 2019/09/25:   Both one and other he denies me now.
      14738: 2019/09/25:   The reason that I gather he is mad,
      14739: 2019/09/25:   Besides this present instance of his rage,
      14740: 2019/09/25:   Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
      14741: 2019/09/25:   Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
      14742: 2019/09/25:   Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
      14743: 2019/09/25:   On purpose shut the doors against his way.
      14744: 2019/09/25:   My way is now to hie home to his house,
      14745: 2019/09/25:   And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
      14746: 2019/09/25:   He rush'd into my house and took perforce
      14747: 2019/09/25:   My ring away. This course I fittest choose,
      14748: 2019/09/25:   For forty ducats is too much to lose.
      14749: 2019/09/25: <Exit

      14751: 2019/09/25: 
      14752: 2019/09/25: SCENE 4
      14753: 2019/09/25: 
      14754: 2019/09/25: A street
      14755: 2019/09/25: 
      14756: 2019/09/25: Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OFFICER
      14757: 2019/09/25: 
      14758: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
      14759: 2019/09/25:   I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
      14760: 2019/09/25:   To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
      14761: 2019/09/25:   My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
      14762: 2019/09/25:   And will not lightly trust the messenger.
      14763: 2019/09/25:   That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
      14764: 2019/09/25:   I tell you 'twill sound harshly in her cars.
      14765: 2019/09/25: 
      14766: 2019/09/25: Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS, with a rope's-end
      14767: 2019/09/25: 
      14768: 2019/09/25:   Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
      14769: 2019/09/25:   How now, sir! Have you that I sent you for?
      14770: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
      14771: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
      14772: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
      14773: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
      14774: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
      14775: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
      14776: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I
      14777: 2019/09/25:   return'd.
      14778: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
      14779: 2019/09/25: [Beating him]
      14780: 2019/09/25: OFFICER. Good sir, be patient.
      14781: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in
      14782: 2019/09/25:   adversity.
      14783: 2019/09/25: OFFICER. Good now, hold thy tongue.
      14784: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
      14785: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
      14786: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I would I were senseless, sir, that I
      14787: 2019/09/25:   might not feel your blows.
      14788: 2019/09/25: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
      14789: 2019/09/25:   blows, and so is an ass.
      14790: 2019/09/25: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I am an ass indeed; you may prove it
      14791: 2019/09/25:   by my long 'ears. I have served him from the hour of my
      14792: 2019/09/25:   nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for
      14793: 2019/09/25:   my service but blows. When I am cold he heats me with
      14794: 2019/09/25:   beating; when I am warm he cools me with beating. I am
      14795: 2019/09/25:   wak'd with it when I sleep; rais'd with it when I sit; driven
      14796: 2019/09/25:   out of doors with it when I go from home; welcom'd home
      14797: 2019/09/25:   with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders as
      14798: 2019/09/25:   beggar wont her brat; and I think, when he hath lam'd me,
      14799: 2019/09/25:   I shall beg with it from door to door.
      14800: 2019/09/26: 
      14801: 2019/09/26: Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and a SCHOOLMASTER
      14802: 2019/09/26: call'd PINCH
      14803: 2019/09/26: 
      14804: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
      14805: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
      14806: 2019/09/26:   rather, to prophesy like the parrot, 'Beware the rope's-end.'
      14807: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
      14808: 2019/09/26: [Beating him]
      14809: 2019/09/26: COURTEZAN. How say you now? Is not your husband mad?
      14810: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. His incivility confirms no less.
      14811: 2019/09/26:   Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer:
      14812: 2019/09/26:   Establish him in his true sense again,
      14813: 2019/09/26:   And I will please you what you will demand.
      14814: 2019/09/26: LUCIANA. Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
      14815: 2019/09/26: COURTEZAN. Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.
      14816: 2019/09/26: PINCH. Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.
      14817: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
      14818: 2019/09/26: [Striking him]
      14819: 2019/09/26: PINCH. I charge thee, Satan, hous'd within this man,
      14820: 2019/09/26:   To yield possession to my holy prayers,
      14821: 2019/09/26:   And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.
      14822: 2019/09/26:   I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.
      14823: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
      14824: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
      14825: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
      14826: 2019/09/26:   Did this companion with the saffron face
      14827: 2019/09/26:   Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
      14828: 2019/09/26:   Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,
      14829: 2019/09/26:   And I denied to enter in my house?
      14830: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din'd at home,
      14831: 2019/09/26:   Where would you had remain'd until this time,
      14832: 2019/09/26:   Free from these slanders and this open shame!
      14833: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
      14834: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, Sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
      14835: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
      14836: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
      14837: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
      14838: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sans fable, she herself revil'd you there.
      14839: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
      14840: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
      14841: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
      14842: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. In verity, you did. My bones bear witness,
      14843: 2019/09/26:   That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
      14844: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
      14845: 2019/09/26: PINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein,
      14846: 2019/09/26:   And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.
      14847: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
      14848: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
      14849: 2019/09/26:   By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
      14850: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Money by me! Heart and goodwill you might,
      14851: 2019/09/26:   But surely, master, not a rag of money.
      14852: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
      14853: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver'd it.
      14854: 2019/09/26: LUCIANA. And I am witness with her that she did.
      14855: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witness
      14856: 2019/09/26:   That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
      14857: 2019/09/26: PINCH. Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
      14858: 2019/09/26:   I know it by their pale and deadly looks.
      14859: 2019/09/26:   They must be bound, and laid in some dark room.
      14860: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
      14861: 2019/09/26:   And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
      14862: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
      14863: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And, gentle master, I receiv'd no gold;
      14864: 2019/09/26:   But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
      14865: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
      14866: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
      14867: 2019/09/26:   And art confederate with a damned pack
      14868: 2019/09/26:   To make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
      14869: 2019/09/26:   But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
      14870: 2019/09/26:   That would behold in me this shameful sport.
      14871: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.
      14872: 2019/09/26: PINCH. More company! The fiend is strong within him.
      14873: 2019/09/26: 
      14874: 2019/09/26: Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives
      14875: 2019/09/26: 
      14876: 2019/09/26: LUCIANA. Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
      14877: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
      14878: 2019/09/26:   I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them
      14879: 2019/09/26:   To make a rescue?
      14880: 2019/09/26: OFFICER. Masters, let him go;
      14881: 2019/09/26:   He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
      14882: 2019/09/26: PINCH. Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
      14883: 2019/09/26: [They bind DROMIO]
      14884: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
      14885: 2019/09/26:   Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
      14886: 2019/09/26:   Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
      14887: 2019/09/26: OFFICER. He is my prisoner; if I let him go,
      14888: 2019/09/26:   The debt he owes will be requir'd of me.
      14889: 2019/09/26: ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;
      14890: 2019/09/26:   Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
      14891: 2019/09/26:   And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
      14892: 2019/09/26:   Good Master Doctor, see him safe convey'd
      14893: 2019/09/26:   Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
      14894: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
      14895: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, I am here ent'red in bond for you.
      14896: 2019/09/26: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
      14897: 2019/09/26:   dost thou mad me?
      14898: 2019/09/26: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Will you be bound for nothing?
      14899: 2019/09/26:   Be mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'
      14900: 2019/09/27: LUCIANA. God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
      14901: 2019/09/27: ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
      14902: 2019/09/27: <Exeunt all but ADRIANA, LUCIANA, OFFICERS, and COURTEZAN
      14903: 2019/09/27:   Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
      14904: 2019/09/27: OFFICER. One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?
      14905: 2019/09/27: ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
      14906: 2019/09/27: OFFICER. Two hundred ducats.
      14907: 2019/09/27: ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?
      14908: 2019/09/27: OFFICER. Due for a chain your husband had of him.
      14909: 2019/09/27: ADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
      14910: 2019/09/27: COURTEZAN. When as your husband, all in rage, to-day
      14911: 2019/09/27:   Came to my house, and took away my ring-
      14912: 2019/09/27:   The ring I saw upon his finger now-
      14913: 2019/09/27:   Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
      14914: 2019/09/27: ADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never see it.
      14915: 2019/09/27:   Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is;
      14916: 2019/09/27:   I long to know the truth hereof at large.
      14917: 2019/09/27: 
      14918: 2019/09/27: Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, with his rapier drawn, and
      14919: 2019/09/27: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.
      14920: 2019/09/27: 
      14921: 2019/09/27: LUCIANA. God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
      14922: 2019/09/27: ADRIANA. And come with naked swords.
      14923: 2019/09/27:   Let's call more help to have them bound again.
      14924: 2019/09/27: OFFICER. Away, they'll kill us!
      14925: 2019/09/27: <Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and
      14926: 2019/09/27: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE as fast as may be, frighted
      14927: 2019/09/27: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
      14928: 2019/09/27: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. She that would be your wife now ran from you.
      14929: 2019/09/27: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
      14930: 2019/09/27:   I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
      14931: 2019/09/27: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, stay here this night; they will
      14932: 2019/09/27:   surely do us no harm; you saw they speak us fair, give us
      14933: 2019/09/27:   gold; methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
      14934: 2019/09/27:   the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me,
      14935: 2019/09/27:   could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch.
      14936: 2019/09/27: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
      14937: 2019/09/27:   Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

      14955: 2019/09/27: 
      14956: 2019/09/27: A street before a priory
      14957: 2019/09/27: 
      14958: 2019/09/27: Enter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO
      14959: 2019/09/27: 
      14960: 2019/09/27: ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
      14961: 2019/09/27:   But I protest he had the chain of me,
      14962: 2019/09/27:   Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
      14963: 2019/09/27: SECOND MERCHANT. How is the man esteem'd here in the city?
      14964: 2019/09/27: ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
      14965: 2019/09/27:   Of credit infinite, highly belov'd,
      14966: 2019/09/27:   Second to none that lives here in the city;
      14967: 2019/09/27:   His word might bear my wealth at any time.
      14968: 2019/09/27: SECOND MERCHANT. Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.
      14969: 2019/09/27: 
      14970: 2019/09/27: Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
      14971: 2019/09/27: 
      14972: 2019/09/27: ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
      14973: 2019/09/27:   Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
      14974: 2019/09/27:   Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
      14975: 2019/09/27:   Signior Andpholus, I wonder much
      14976: 2019/09/27:   That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
      14977: 2019/09/27:   And, not without some scandal to yourself,
      14978: 2019/09/27:   With circumstance and oaths so to deny
      14979: 2019/09/27:   This chain, which now you wear so openly.
      14980: 2019/09/27:   Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
      14981: 2019/09/27:   You have done wrong to this my honest friend;
      14982: 2019/09/27:   Who, but for staying on our controversy,
      14983: 2019/09/27:   Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day.
      14984: 2019/09/27:   This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
      14985: 2019/09/27: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
      14986: 2019/09/27: SECOND MERCHANT. Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
      14987: 2019/09/27: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
      14988: 2019/09/27: SECOND MERCHANT. These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.
      14989: 2019/09/27:   Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou liv'st
      14990: 2019/09/27:   To walk where any honest men resort.
      14991: 2019/09/27: ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
      14992: 2019/09/27:   I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
      14993: 2019/09/27:   Against thee presently, if thou dar'st stand.
      14994: 2019/09/27: SECOND MERCHANT. I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
      14995: 2019/09/27: [They draw]
      14996: 2019/09/27: 
      14997: 2019/09/27: Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and OTHERS
      14998: 2019/09/27: 
      14999: 2019/09/27: ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad.
      15000: 2019/09/28:   Some get within him, take his sword away;
      15001: 2019/09/28:   Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.
      15002: 2019/09/28: DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Run, master, run; for God's sake take a house.
      15003: 2019/09/28:   This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd.
      15004: 2019/09/28: <Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory
      15005: 2019/09/28: 
      15006: 2019/09/28: Enter the LADY ABBESS
      15007: 2019/09/28: 
      15008: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?
      15009: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
      15010: 2019/09/28:   Let us come in, that we may bind him fast,
      15011: 2019/09/28:   And bear him home for his recovery.
      15012: 2019/09/28: ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
      15013: 2019/09/28: SECOND MERCHANT. I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
      15014: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man?
      15015: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
      15016: 2019/09/28:   And much different from the man he was;
      15017: 2019/09/28:   But till this afternoon his passion
      15018: 2019/09/28:   Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
      15019: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
      15020: 2019/09/28:   Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
      15021: 2019/09/28:   Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
      15022: 2019/09/28:   A sin prevailing much in youthful men
      15023: 2019/09/28:   Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
      15024: 2019/09/28:   Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
      15025: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last;
      15026: 2019/09/28:   Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
      15027: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. You should for that have reprehended him.
      15028: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. Why, so I did.
      15029: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. Ay, but not rough enough.
      15030: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.
      15031: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. Haply in private.
      15032: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. And in assemblies too.
      15033: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. Ay, but not enough.
      15034: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference.
      15035: 2019/09/28:   In bed, he slept not for my urging it;
      15036: 2019/09/28:   At board, he fed not for my urging it;
      15037: 2019/09/28:   Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
      15038: 2019/09/28:   In company, I often glanced it;
      15039: 2019/09/28:   Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
      15040: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. And thereof came it that the man was mad.
      15041: 2019/09/28:   The venom clamours of a jealous woman
      15042: 2019/09/28:   Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
      15043: 2019/09/28:   It seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,
      15044: 2019/09/28:   And thereof comes it that his head is light.
      15045: 2019/09/28:   Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings:
      15046: 2019/09/28:   Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
      15047: 2019/09/28:   Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
      15048: 2019/09/28:   And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
      15049: 2019/09/28:   Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls.
      15050: 2019/09/28:   Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
      15051: 2019/09/28:   But moody and dull melancholy,
      15052: 2019/09/28:   Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
      15053: 2019/09/28:   And at her heels a huge infectious troop
      15054: 2019/09/28:   Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
      15055: 2019/09/28:   In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
      15056: 2019/09/28:   To be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.
      15057: 2019/09/28:   The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits
      15058: 2019/09/28:   Hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.
      15059: 2019/09/28: LUCIANA. She never reprehended him but mildly,
      15060: 2019/09/28:   When he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly.
      15061: 2019/09/28:   Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?
      15062: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof.
      15063: 2019/09/28:   Good people, enter, and lay hold on him.
      15064: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. No, not a creature enters in my house.
      15065: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
      15066: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. Neither; he took this place for sanctuary,
      15067: 2019/09/28:   And it shall privilege him from your hands
      15068: 2019/09/28:   Till I have brought him to his wits again,
      15069: 2019/09/28:   Or lose my labour in assaying it.
      15070: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
      15071: 2019/09/28:   Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
      15072: 2019/09/28:   And will have no attorney but myself;
      15073: 2019/09/28:   And therefore let me have him home with me.
      15074: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. Be patient; for I will not let him stir
      15075: 2019/09/28:   Till I have us'd the approved means I have,
      15076: 2019/09/28:   With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,
      15077: 2019/09/28:   To make of him a formal man again.
      15078: 2019/09/28:   It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
      15079: 2019/09/28:   A charitable duty of my order;
      15080: 2019/09/28:   Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.
      15081: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here;
      15082: 2019/09/28:   And ill it doth beseem your holiness
      15083: 2019/09/28:   To separate the husband and the wife.
      15084: 2019/09/28: ABBESS. Be quiet, and depart; thou shalt not have him.
      15085: 2019/09/28: <Exit
      15086: 2019/09/28: LUCIANA. Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.
      15087: 2019/09/28: ADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,
      15088: 2019/09/28:   And never rise until my tears and prayers
      15089: 2019/09/28:   Have won his Grace to come in person hither
      15090: 2019/09/28:   And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
      15091: 2019/09/28: SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five;
      15092: 2019/09/28:   Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person
      15093: 2019/09/28:   Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
      15094: 2019/09/28:   The place of death and sorry execution,
      15095: 2019/09/28:   Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
      15096: 2019/09/28: ANGELO. Upon what cause?
      15097: 2019/09/28: SECOND MERCHANT. To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
      15098: 2019/09/28:   Who put unluckily into this bay
      15099: 2019/09/28:   Against the laws and statutes of this town,
      15100: 2019/09/29:   Beheaded publicly for his offence.
      15101: 2019/09/29: ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
      15102: 2019/09/29: LUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.
      15103: 2019/09/29: 
      15104: 2019/09/29: Enter the DUKE, attended; AEGEON, bareheaded;
      15105: 2019/09/29: with the HEADSMAN and other OFFICERS
      15106: 2019/09/29: 
      15107: 2019/09/29: DUKE. Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
      15108: 2019/09/29:   If any friend will pay the sum for him,
      15109: 2019/09/29:   He shall not die; so much we tender him.
      15110: 2019/09/29: ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess!
      15111: 2019/09/29: DUKE. She is a virtuous and a reverend lady;
      15112: 2019/09/29:   It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
      15113: 2019/09/29: ADRIANA. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
      15114: 2019/09/29:   Who I made lord of me and all I had
      15115: 2019/09/29:   At your important letters-this ill day
      15116: 2019/09/29:   A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
      15117: 2019/09/29:   That desp'rately he hurried through the street,
      15118: 2019/09/29:   With him his bondman all as mad as he,
      15119: 2019/09/29:   Doing displeasure to the citizens
      15120: 2019/09/29:   By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
      15121: 2019/09/29:   Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.
      15122: 2019/09/29:   Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
      15123: 2019/09/29:   Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
      15124: 2019/09/29:   That here and there his fury had committed.
      15125: 2019/09/29:   Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
      15126: 2019/09/29:   He broke from those that had the guard of him,
      15127: 2019/09/29:   And with his mad attendant and himself,
      15128: 2019/09/29:   Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
      15129: 2019/09/29:   Met us again and, madly bent on us,
      15130: 2019/09/29:   Chas'd us away; till, raising of more aid,
      15131: 2019/09/29:   We came again to bind them. Then they fled
      15132: 2019/09/29:   Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;
      15133: 2019/09/29:   And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us,
      15134: 2019/09/29:   And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
      15135: 2019/09/29:   Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
      15136: 2019/09/29:   Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command
      15137: 2019/09/29:   Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
      15138: 2019/09/29: DUKE. Long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars,
      15139: 2019/09/29:   And I to thee engag'd a prince's word,
      15140: 2019/09/29:   When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
      15141: 2019/09/29:   To do him all the grace and good I could.
      15142: 2019/09/29:   Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,
      15143: 2019/09/29:   And bid the Lady Abbess come to me,
      15144: 2019/09/29:   I will determine this before I stir.
      15145: 2019/09/29: 
      15146: 2019/09/29: Enter a MESSENGER
      15147: 2019/09/29: 
      15148: 2019/09/29: MESSENGER. O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
      15149: 2019/09/29:   My master and his man are both broke loose,
      15150: 2019/09/29:   Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor,
      15151: 2019/09/29:   Whose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire;
      15152: 2019/09/29:   And ever, as it blaz'd, they threw on him
      15153: 2019/09/29:   Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.
      15154: 2019/09/29:   My master preaches patience to him, and the while
      15155: 2019/09/29:   His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;
      15156: 2019/09/29:   And sure, unless you send some present help,
      15157: 2019/09/29:   Between them they will kill the conjurer.
      15158: 2019/09/29: ADRIANA. Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
      15159: 2019/09/29:   And that is false thou dost report to us.
      15160: 2019/09/29: MESSENGER. Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
      15161: 2019/09/29:   I have not breath'd almost since I did see it.
      15162: 2019/09/29:   He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
      15163: 2019/09/29:   To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.
      15164: 2019/09/29: [Cry within]
      15165: 2019/09/29:   Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress; fly, be gone!
      15166: 2019/09/29: DUKE. Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds.
      15167: 2019/09/29: ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you
      15168: 2019/09/29:   That he is borne about invisible.
      15169: 2019/09/29:   Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here,
      15170: 2019/09/29:   And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
      15171: 2019/09/29: 
      15172: 2019/09/29: Enter ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS and DROMIO OFEPHESUS
      15173: 2019/09/29: 
      15174: 2019/09/29: ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
      15175: 2019/09/29:   Even for the service that long since I did thee,
      15176: 2019/09/29:   When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took
      15177: 2019/09/29:   Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
      15178: 2019/09/29:   That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
      15179: 2019/09/29: AEGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
      15180: 2019/09/29:   I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.
      15181: 2019/09/29: ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
      15182: 2019/09/29:   She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,
      15183: 2019/09/29:   That hath abused and dishonoured me
      15184: 2019/09/29:   Even in the strength and height of injury.
      15185: 2019/09/29:   Beyond imagination is the wrong
      15186: 2019/09/29:   That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
      15187: 2019/09/29: DUKE. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
      15188: 2019/09/29: ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
      15189: 2019/09/29:   While she with harlots feasted in my house.
      15190: 2019/09/29: DUKE. A grievous fault. Say, woman, didst thou so?
      15191: 2019/09/29: ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister,
      15192: 2019/09/29:   To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
      15193: 2019/09/29:   As this is false he burdens me withal!
      15194: 2019/09/29: LUCIANA. Ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night
      15195: 2019/09/29:   But she tells to your Highness simple truth!
      15196: 2019/09/29: ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
      15197: 2019/09/29:   In this the madman justly chargeth them.
      15198: 2019/09/29: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
      15199: 2019/09/29:   Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
      15200: 2019/09/30:   Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,
      15201: 2019/09/30:   Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
      15202: 2019/09/30:   This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner;
      15203: 2019/09/30:   That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
      15204: 2019/09/30:   Could witness it, for he was with me then;
      15205: 2019/09/30:   Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
      15206: 2019/09/30:   Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
      15207: 2019/09/30:   Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
      15208: 2019/09/30:   Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
      15209: 2019/09/30:   I went to seek him. In the street I met him,
      15210: 2019/09/30:   And in his company that gentleman.
      15211: 2019/09/30:   There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
      15212: 2019/09/30:   That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,
      15213: 2019/09/30:   Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which
      15214: 2019/09/30:   He did arrest me with an officer.
      15215: 2019/09/30:   I did obey, and sent my peasant home
      15216: 2019/09/30:   For certain ducats; he with none return'd.
      15217: 2019/09/30:   Then fairly I bespoke the officer
      15218: 2019/09/30:   To go in person with me to my house.
      15219: 2019/09/30:   By th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more
      15220: 2019/09/30:   Of vile confederates. Along with them
      15221: 2019/09/30:   They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,
      15222: 2019/09/30:   A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
      15223: 2019/09/30:   A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
      15224: 2019/09/30:   A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
      15225: 2019/09/30:   A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
      15226: 2019/09/30:   Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
      15227: 2019/09/30:   And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
      15228: 2019/09/30:   And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
      15229: 2019/09/30:   Cries out I was possess'd. Then all together
      15230: 2019/09/30:   They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,
      15231: 2019/09/30:   And in a dark and dankish vault at home
      15232: 2019/09/30:   There left me and my man, both bound together;
      15233: 2019/09/30:   Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
      15234: 2019/09/30:   I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
      15235: 2019/09/30:   Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech
      15236: 2019/09/30:   To give me ample satisfaction
      15237: 2019/09/30:   For these deep shames and great indignities.
      15238: 2019/09/30: ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
      15239: 2019/09/30:   That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.
      15240: 2019/09/30: DUKE. But had he such a chain of thee, or no?
      15241: 2019/09/30: ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
      15242: 2019/09/30:   These people saw the chain about his neck.
      15243: 2019/09/30: SECOND MERCHANT. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
      15244: 2019/09/30:   Heard you confess you had the chain of him,
      15245: 2019/09/30:   After you first forswore it on the mart;
      15246: 2019/09/30:   And thereupon I drew my sword on you,
      15247: 2019/09/30:   And then you fled into this abbey here,
      15248: 2019/09/30:   From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
      15249: 2019/09/30: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
      15250: 2019/09/30:   Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;
      15251: 2019/09/30:   I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
      15252: 2019/09/30:   And this is false you burden me withal.
      15253: 2019/09/30: DUKE. Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
      15254: 2019/09/30:   I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
      15255: 2019/09/30:   If here you hous'd him, here he would have been;
      15256: 2019/09/30:   If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
      15257: 2019/09/30:   You say he din'd at home: the goldsmith here
      15258: 2019/09/30:   Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
      15259: 2019/09/30: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he din'd with her there, at the Porpentine.
      15260: 2019/09/30: COURTEZAN. He did; and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
      15261: 2019/09/30: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
      15262: 2019/09/30: DUKE. Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
      15263: 2019/09/30: COURTEZAN. As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.
      15264: 2019/09/30: DUKE. Why, this is strange. Go call the Abbess hither.
      15265: 2019/09/30:   I think you are all mated or stark mad.
      15266: 2019/09/30: <Exit one to the ABBESS
      15267: 2019/09/30: AEGEON. Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
      15268: 2019/09/30:   Haply I see a friend will save my life
      15269: 2019/09/30:   And pay the sum that may deliver me.
      15270: 2019/09/30: DUKE. Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
      15271: 2019/09/30: AEGEON. Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
      15272: 2019/09/30:   And is not that your bondman Dromio?
      15273: 2019/09/30: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,
      15274: 2019/09/30:   But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords
      15275: 2019/09/30:   Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
      15276: 2019/09/30: AEGEON. I am sure you both of you remember me.
      15277: 2019/09/30: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
      15278: 2019/09/30:   For lately we were bound as you are now.
      15279: 2019/09/30:   You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
      15280: 2019/09/30: AEGEON. Why look you strange on me? You know me well.
      15281: 2019/09/30: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
      15282: 2019/09/30: AEGEON. O! grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last;
      15283: 2019/09/30:   And careful hours with time's deformed hand
      15284: 2019/09/30:   Have written strange defeatures in my face.
      15285: 2019/09/30:   But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
      15286: 2019/09/30: ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
      15287: 2019/09/30: AEGEON. Dromio, nor thou?
      15288: 2019/09/30: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, trust me, sir, nor I.
      15289: 2019/09/30: AEGEON. I am sure thou dost.
      15290: 2019/09/30: DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and
      15291: 2019/09/30:   whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
      15292: 2019/09/30: AEGEON. Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
      15293: 2019/09/30:   Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
      15294: 2019/09/30:   In seven short years that here my only son
      15295: 2019/09/30:   Knows not my feeble key of untun'd cares?
      15296: 2019/09/30:   Though now this grained face of mine be hid
      15297: 2019/09/30:   In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
      15298: 2019/09/30:   And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
      15299: 2019/09/30:   Yet hath my night of life some memory,
